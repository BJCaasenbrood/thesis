\chapterabstract{
The infinite dimensional nature of soft robots has emphasized the difficulty in its modeling and control, leading to the classic trade-off between precision and speed. In the past decade, two popular modeling strategies have been postulated: \textit{i)} finite element models and \textit{ii)} beam models (like polynomial curvature or Cosserat models).
In this work, we propose mixture between the two modeling approaches by exploring modal shape reconstruction through Proper-Orthogonal-Decomposition (POD) of FEM-driven data to shape the configuration space of the Cosserat beam models. Our method offers a unique balance between the modeling strategies, including the preservation of highly accurate (volumetric) deformations of soft hyper-elastic materials, high computational speed, an energy-equivalent modeling structure useful for control.}
