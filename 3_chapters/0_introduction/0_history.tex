\section{History of soft robotics: what are they?} 
\label{sec:intro:history}
Biological systems have long been an inspiration for roboticist to make more robust and capable machines. While holding these pages in one's hand, one might wonder \textit{'how do we interact with so many different objects so effortlessly on a daily basis?'}. A conventional (rigid) robot, on the other hand, needs to know the exact weight, shape, and orientation of an object to interact with it safely and robustly. These philosophies adopted from nature are now presented into machines that accordingly shaped a new robotics discipline called \emph{soft robotics}. Contrary to rigid robots, these machines are made from softer materials. Softness here refers to the enveloping properties of low elasticity materials. Indeed, by observing common materials in robotics and their elastic moduli (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:elasticity}), we observe a gap between machine and nature. It is believed that the lack of material diversity in robotics might be the missing puzzle piece of achieving bio-like performance in modern machines.
%A common measure of the elasticity is the Young's modulus. Although it only applies to homogenous materials subject to small deformations, it can be explored to classify rigidity in robotics. To aid the reader, we have provided a spectrum of different materials in Figure \ref{fig:C0:elasticity}. Observing this spectrum, we see that biological organisms are mostly composed of materials with low moduli in the order of $10^4 - 10^7$ \si{Pa} (\eg, muscle or skin tissue) and sparsely of rigid materials, \eg, bone. Classic robotics, on the other hand, are predominantly composed of hard materials, like metals or hard plastics. 
% It is interesting to observe that the materials responsible for motion, which naturally undergo repeated deformation, have accordingly low elasticity. As opposed to the use of rigid materials in classic robotics. 
The idea of exploring low elasticity materials in robotics, so-called \textit{soft material}, has sparked a new direction in robotics aimed at harmonizing robots and biology. Before continuing, we introduce the following definition:
%
\terminology{\textbf{Soft materials} are a class of homogenous materials with a Young's modulus (\ie, the modulus of elasticity) lower than $E \le 10^9$ \si{\pascal}. Following, the word softness refers to the collection of mechanical properties that are often associated with these low moduli materials.}{}\
%
Now, although the words \emph{soft} and \emph{robotics} have a clear definition independently, the collocation of the two sparked many vivid discussions and new idealogies within the robotics community for the past two decades. Throughout its young academic life, several defintions have been coined. Early terms for soft robotics were used to indicate robots with variable joint stiffness \cite{AlbuSchaffer2004}, or artificial compliance through control \cite{AlbuSchaffer2011}. The term was also used to underline the shift from rigid-linked robots to \textit{bio-inspired continuum robots are inherently compliant and that exhibit large strains in normal operations} \cite{Trivedi2008}. Paraphrasing the work of Robison et al. (1999, \cite{Robinson1999}): \textit{soft robotic manipulators are continuum robots made of soft materials that undergo continuous elastic deformation and produce motion through the generation of a smooth backbone curve}. Alternatively, a broader definition was coined in a review by Kim et al. (\cite{Kim2013}, 2013) simply referring to soft-bodied robots as \textit{an analogy to soft-bodied animals}. A concise (but generic) definition was proposed by Laschi et al. (\cite{Laschi2014}, 2014), as soft robots being \textit{any robot built by soft materials}. Rus et al. (2015, \cite{Rus2015}) defined soft robots in terms of their structural elasticity: \textit{Systems that are capable of autonomous behavior, and that are primarily composed of materials with moduli in the range of that of soft biological materials}.

\end{figure}
%
\par Although the debate on the exact terminology is still ongoing, and perhaps may never be closed; we will propose a terminology applicable to this thesis. Our definition is based on the history of soft robotics and the scientific trends in modern literature related to the topics of design and control. Naturally, given its multi-disciplinary nature, the terms used in this thesis might deviate from the aforementioned literature. Nevertheless, we propose the following definition for soft robotics:
%
\terminology{\textbf{Soft robotics} is a subclass of robotics with purposefully designed compliant actuators embedded into their mechanical structure whose goal is to endow the robot with natural (or biological) motion or compliance.}{}
%
This definition is adopted from the work of Della Santina et al. (2020, \cite{DellaSantina2020Springer}), but modified to highlight the importance of soft materials to mimic biological motion -- also referred to as \emph{bio-mimicry}. The ambition of closely mimicking biological creatures is perhaps not commonly associated with the field of robotics, given its important role in the automation industry, yet the inception of robotics can originally be found in bio-mimicry when regarding its rich history. In this section, we will present a short historical overview of soft robotics. Hereby showing that the current trends of bio-mimicry and elasticity in robotics find roots in a periods way before the soft robotic boom in the early 2010's. To guide the reader, in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}, we provide a graphical, historic overview of soft robotic systems from 1960 to 2022. We will discuss the inception of soft actuation, early soft robotic designs, and modeling and control strategies for these continuum robotics.

%\textbf{(Biomimicry in early automata)} One of the earliest examples of bio-mimicry is a mechanical wooden dove developed by mathematician Archytas of Tarentum in 350 BC. According to historians, the system was driven by compressed air or an internal steam-driven engine to achieve forward propulsion. It was believed to achieve traveling distances of ~200 \si{\meter} (see note\footnote{It was unclear if the devices was attached to a rope, or autonomous flight was achieved.}). Although might argue its lacks to sophistication to be considered a \emph{robot}, Archytas's invention could be considered as one of the earliest examples aviation, as its mechanical principles of achieving motion are undoubtedly similar to nowadays \emph{drone} technology. A millennium later, in the period of the High Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci designed and constructed a mechanical knight around the 1490's -- and is thought to be the earliest robotic system. The mechanical constructions are perhaps closer to classical robots given our current perspective, and it was capable of various complex motions using preprogrammed sequences. 
%It is well-known that his work was built upon extensive anatomical research, which may have facilitated a deep understanding of the human body into the mechanical knight's robotic design. Given the work of Archytas and Da Vinci, biomimicry played a paramount role in the development of robot technologies before the term \emph{robot} was even introduced.

%\par In the 1920's, shortly after the second industrial revolution (1870 - 1914) and the first world war (1914), the first usage of the work \emph{robot} appeared -- originally meaning 'forced labor by serfs' (\ie, peasants) derived from the Czech word \emph{robota}. An common misconception is that robot implies slave, nonetheless, its origin is somewhat related. The word was popularized by Karel \v{C}apek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots) that involves an inventor named Rossum who discovers the secret of creating human-like machines. In his play, Rossom's robots assisted or fully alleviated mankind from any labor. Through human's ambition to assimilate man and machine, the robots ultimately gained the capacity for emotions. Shortly after, the robots, who were created to serve humans, have come to dominate mankind completely. The word \emph{robotics} was later solidified by Isaac Asimov, adapting the term from \v{C}apek. These works of science fiction are perhaps the fundamental groundwork of modern robotics which have led to the base practices of robotics and its corresponding academic field.

\textbf{Early soft actuation in robotics}. To relate the historical progress of soft robots to rigid robots, let us begin with early rigid robots. In 1954, George Devol filed a patent describing an autonomous robotic machine that could be preprogrammed to execute step-by-step motions \cite{Mickle2008}. The machine was designed to reduce the workload on the manufacturing work floor, with a major focus on mimicking repetitive (exhausting) human labor. In 1958, those prototypes led to a robotic system under the name \emph{Unimate}. An illustration of this early rigid robot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}. The Unimate was used for manipulating metal die-casts and welding these to the main body of automobiles. In doing so revolutionizing the car industry shortly after. Much later (1969), Victor Scheinman created the Stanford Arm \cite{BibEntryStanford2022Sep,BibEntryOrm2019Sep}, recognized as the first electronic computer-controlled robotic arm because the Unimate's instructions (\ie, predefined setpoints in joint space) were prerecorded on a magnetic drum. He later developed the well-known PUMA robot in 1972 (video available at \cite{BibEntryPuma2022Sep}) -- the successor to the Unimate. Keep Scheinman in mind, as he ultimately ties to early soft robots. \vspace{0.085em}

Nearly four years after the Unimate was developed, Joseph L. McKibben developed a pneumatic muscle-inspired actuator capable of linear contraction -- called the McKibben actuator. The McKibben muscle is a type of Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) which is to this date the most frequently used and published artificial muscle in literature. According to \cite{Mckibben}, he developed the McKibben actuators to bring motion to his little daughter's polio-paralyzed hand. His aim was that eventually such pneumatic actuators may help patients with paralyzed fingers to move, grasp, and even write. Inspired by the human muscle, the McKibben actuator consists of an inflatable inner bladder enveloped with a double-helical weave. When pressurized, the fluidic actuator converts radial expansion into uni-axial contraction \cite{Daerden1999,Daerden2000,Schulte1961} since weave inhibits extensive \emph{ballooning} -- a term for undesired rapidly-accelerated volumetric expansion. Its material composition is often silicone rubber with a nylon-fiber exterior. A schematic representation of a general pneumatic muscle and the effect of ballooning are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}. Ballooning is an (often undesired) nonlinear effect, where the hyper-elastic pressure vessel exhibits strain-softening after a critical point is reached. As a result, further increase of the pressure leads to an exponential growth in volume, which ultimately leads to actuator tearing. At stages of ballooning, mechanical performance significantly drops and even produces adverse effects, like actuation reversal. McKibben solved this problem through a combination of soft and inextensible fiber weaves. These inextensible were placed at the exterior wall of the soft muscle, thereby limiting the radial expansion before ballooning could occur. According to Daerden (1999, \cite{Daerden1999}), there exist many variations of pneumatic muscle besides braided muscles, such as the \emph{netted muscles} (e.g, Yarlott \cite{Yarlott1972}, ROMAC \cite{Immega1986}, and Kukolj \cite{Kukolj1988}) and \emph{embedded muscles} (\eg, Morin \cite{Morin1953}, Paynter Hyperboloid \cite{Paynter1988}). Illustration of their patent schematics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:several_PAM}.

Pneumatic muscles are perhaps one of the first fundamental technologies that enabled soft robotics, and to this day, it remains a framework for many soft robotic systems. Nevertheless, besides the many examples of fluidics \cite{Marchese2014,Marchese2016,Katzschmann2018,Suzumori1991,Mosadegh2014}, there exist many other technologies employed in soft robotic motion: such as thermal \cite{Wu2021Dec} or chemical expansion/contraction \cite{Tolley2014,Bartlett2015,Wehner2016}, crystal re-alignment \cite{Pilz2020,Lopez2018,Vantomme2021,Polygerinos2013}, di-electric elastomers \cite{Keplinger2011}, magnetism \cite{Roh2019Apr,KimYoonho2018,McDonald2020,Boyvat2017Jul}, and naturally the use of tendons paired with electro-mechanical actuation \cite{Renda2018,Bern2019,Kim2020Jun,Coevoet2017Feb,Wang2016Sep}. Some predate the invention of the McKibben actuator. For example, a popular soft actuation principle still applied in soft robotics today are Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEA) developed by R\"{o}ntgen in 1880 \cite{Rontgen1880}. Therefore, given the abundance of soft robotic actuation, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact date of origin of soft actuation technology. Note, however, that these systems are not categorized as soft robots, they are categorized as soft actuators. Here, we emphasize the difference between soft actuators and soft robots in view of the modeling and control terminology relevant to the thesis:

\terminology{\textbf{Soft actuators} are controllable flexible actuation units of the constitute soft robot that through external stimuli are responsible for natural motion and/or change in adaptive compliance. %By definition, a soft actuator is a single-input-multi-output (SIMO) system.
}{}
%
\vspace{-4mm}
%
\begin{rmk} The terminology above attempts to address an ambiguity common to soft robotics, namely the interchangeable use of soft actuator and soft robot. The thesis invokes that soft robots must be comprised of multiple soft actuators that connect to a passive deformable body. Here, the soft body functions as a mechanical conduit between actuators, sensors, and the environment.
\end{rmk}
  %Let us also introduce the dual of soft actuators -- namely the \emph{soft sensor} that relate measurements to the motion of soft actuators:

\textbf{Origin of soft robotics}. Returning to 1965, nearly a decade after the invention of the McKibben actuator and the Unimate robot, Scheinman and Leifer proposed a novel pneumatic robotic arm named the \emph{Orm} -- Norwegian for snake (recall that he also developed the popular PUMA robot \cite{BibEntryPuma2022Sep}). The name was also an abbreviation for Object-Relational Mapping tool \cite{Corke2020}. To the author's knowledge, this is believed to be the first instance of a soft robotic system. Surprisingly the system predates any rigid snake-like robot, like the Scripps tensor arm by Anderson (1968, \cite{Anderson1968}). Inspired by the anatomy of snakes, the system featured 28 rubber pneumatic artificial muscle (\ie, bellows) distributed along a flexible backbone (\ie, skeletal support). The network of artificial muscles were sandwiched between steel plates to prevent misalignment. It is worth mentioning that the technology is analogous to the pneumatic McKibben muscle, where fiber weaves are used to prevent ballooning. Yet, contrary to a single McKibben actuator, the soft robotic system could undergo three-dimensional movement by inflation or deflation of an embedded pneumatic network. This led to a rich set of movements previously unseen in rigid robotics. As an illustrative example, we provided the mechanics of the Orm soft robot in Figure \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}. The soft robot could achieve bending in any preferred direction by differential pressurization of each channel, and elongation through synchronized actuation. Most notably, comparing the volume-strain response of the Orm with respect to the McKibben actuator, \ie, comparing Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben} against \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}, it is noticeably more linear in nature. Although not documented at the time, the comparison highlights the importance of structural geometry in pneumatic muscle networks.

By actuation of the pneumatic network, both elongation and bending can be achieved. Observe that the response is significantly more linear than McKibben actuators in Fig. \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}, emphasizing the importance of geometry.

\end{figure}

According to an interview with Scheinman led by Asaro et al. \cite{ETHW2020Dec} in 2010, the positional accuracy of the system was poor, yet the concepts of pneumatically-driven soft arms continued for many years. The positional inaccuracy of pneumatic soft actuators at the time may have caused its lost of academic interest in the 60's. Three years later, in 1968, an improved hyper-redundant robot manipulator was proposed and patented by Anderson and Horn \cite{Anderson1968} (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}). Improving upon the Orm, which was deemed slow and had limited positional accuracy, Anderson proposed an array of nylon tendons that were connected to rigid discs distributed along the redundant backbone of the robot. The configurable backbone was comprised of universal spherical joints that allow for pivoting motion with respect to other discs -- totalling 16 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs). The entire arm was actuated hydraulically, yet the (soft) actuators were placed outside the robot's body rather than placed at each joint, like the Orm. To improve positional accuracy further, Anderson placed sensor tendons parallel the actuator tendons which allowed for operator-based positional feedback. Although Anderson's robot does not categorize as a soft robot since it relies mostly on rigid materials, its flexibility arose from thin nylon tendons that were used for both actuation and sensing. Anderson showed that a network of distributed sensors are necessary to control the complex morphological shapes in  hyper-redundant robotic systems, while also mitigating the sensor's effect on mobility. Within this context, let us define soft sensors:

\terminology{\textbf{(Proprioceptive) soft sensors} are flexible measurements units embedded into the soft robotic body that through external stimuli measure the (local) changes of the system. Softness here implies that the sensor minimally alters the global mechanical behavior of the robot. %By definition, a soft sensor is a multi-input-single-output (MISO) system.
}{}
%
\begin{rmk}
  \vspace{-1mm}
As the emphasize lies on "minimally alters the global mechanical behavior", soft sensors may be composed of stiff (perhaps even rigid) components. Our definition infers that these sensors must be placed into or onto the soft body, minimally affecting the operational workspace of the soft actuator network in static or dynamic condition.
\end{rmk}

\textbf{Soft robotics in the 80's}. Following the fundamental works of McKibben, Scheinman and Anderson, the field of soft Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) in robotics evolved rapidly in the early 80's. A few soft robotic systems are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:earlyPAMrobots}. Teleshev (1981, \cite{Teleshev1981}) developed a soft gripper reminiscent of modern PneuNet actuators \cite{Galloway2016,Mosadegh2014,Choi2011} -- a rectangular bellow-shaped soft actuator. Unlike uniaxial PAMs, which are radially symmetric, these soft grippers explored an asymmetrical design of bellows. The geometry led to a stiffness differential around the circumference, resulting in their icon bending motion. Still popular today, these pneumatic bending actuators find their origin back in early 1974, see Andorf et al. (1974, \cite{Andorf1974}). A decade later, Takagi et al. (\cite{Takagi1983}, 1983) developed a soft multi-joint robot manipulator that resembles the human arm with its movements and antagonistic muscle pairs. Although, their PAMs -- called \textit{Rubbertuator} -- had a function and design identical to McKibben's PAMs, their system showed the merits of combining soft and rigid. They observed not only a high-degree of positional control of the robot arm, force control was easily regulated by the pressure control. This naturally had safety benefits. The soft robot arm could perform delicate low-force tasks while simultaneously blocking motion when encountering a human. These (soft) properties were lacking in rigid robotic manipulators at the time but reminiscent in its biological counterpart -- the human arm. Note that, at that time, force and impedance control for rigid robotics had been topics of academic research for years \cite{Anderson1988,Khatib1987,Hogan1984,Hogan1984Jan}, dating back to the early 1970's. (\eg, see also \cite{Markiewicz1973}). Yet achieving similar properties without control were rarely explored at the time.

%
\par Shortly after, Wilson (1984, \cite{Wilson2007}) developed a soft robot manipulator based on the elephant's trunk at Duke University, Durham. His design effectively combined the works of Teleshev \cite{Teleshev1981} and Takagi et al. \cite{Takagi1983} into a robot with similar dexterity but minimal use of rigid components. According to \cite{Weisburd1988}, his idea stemmed from the work of Kier and Smith (1985, \cite{Kier1985}) who studied the biomechanics of muscular-hydrostats in animals, like cephalopods (\eg, squids). The work of Kier et al. \cite{Kier1985} studied how complex motions are produces in muscular organs, like elongation, shortening, bending and torsion. Inspired by the muscular hydrostat in the elephant's trunk, Wilson developed a soft arm composed of polyurethane tubes that work as half-bellows, which enabled expansion and bending under positive pressurization \cite{Weisburd1988}. To accommodate for three-dimensional movement, each soft pneumatic link was placed at a $ \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$ twist offset w.r.t. to the previous link. To illustrate the motion of the soft arm, a few snapshots are provided in Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_srm_robot}. Wilson hypothesized that these highly-complaint robots will be more mechanically robust and be sufficiently dexterous for tight workspaces, contrary to its rigid counterparts. Although the dexterity was novel, the positional accuracy was poor. The main problem stemmed from the soft arm being controlled in open-loop (\ie, remote tele-operation) without proprioceptive sensing nor any positional feedback control. An issue akin to the Orm (1965). 

A few years later, Buckley et al. (1988, \cite{Buckley2012}) developed the Shadow walker -- a bipedal rigid robot comprised of antagonistic McKibben muscle pairs. Although not fully soft, their system did explore proprioceptive sensing. The hip, knee, and ankle joints were equipped with resistance-variable potentiometers for position feedback, whereas all the muscles had tension sensors for force feedback. Later on, these resistive sensors were replaced by analog optical sensors to improve robustness \cite{Buckley2012}. Although the system was top-heavy, due to the pneumatic control hardware (\eg, valves and piping), rudimentary locomotion was possible. Interestingly, a similar artificial muscle system is still explored in nowadays humanoid robotics, like the Atlas from Boston Dynamics. The success of pairing soft muscles with proprioceptive sensing eventually led to the development of the McKibben Shadow hand \cite{Buckley2012,Gong2022Feb}, comprised of 40 uniquely addressable soft muscles.

Each finger possess three pneumatic chambers that allow for directional bending -- analogous the Orm. Through proper coordination of the set of soft fingers various gripping complexity can be achieved, such as the clock-wise turning a mechanical hex bolt (as shown above). Suzumori et al. showed these intricate finger motions can be easily achieved by careful modeling of the fingertip dynamics, and exploring the adaptability of soft materials.

Following, Suzumori and Saiko (1989, \cite{Suzumori1991,Suzumori1992}) developed a micro flexible soft actuator driven by an electro-hydraulic system (intrinsic length $L \approx12$ \si{\milli \meter}). Each end-effector enables three DOFs including pitch, yaw, and stretch -- making it ideal for fingers, arms and legs. Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_grip_robot} shows the level of dexterity in their system. By placing the four PAMs parallel on a gripper mount, and assigning a pre-defined trajectory, they showed their soft robotic system has sufficient dexterity to mount an hex-bolt at an incredible speed and precision. To achieve such dexterity and precision, Suzumori et al. \cite{Suzumori1991} employed various modeling and control strategies to account for the dynamical characteristics under high-frequency, fluid compressibility, and the closing mechanics of pressure valves. Futhermore, the kinematics of each finger was derived using generalized homogenous transformation, not unlike traditional robotics. Knowing both the compliance characteristics (pressure-deformation relations) and the forward kinematics, a Jacobian-based positional controller was employed to regulate the Cartesian coordinates of the finger-tips (successfully one might add).

\par \textbf{Early controllers for hyper-redundant (soft) robots}. Following the increasing interest in highly-flexible robots around the late 80's, academic research into controlling these \textit{hyper-redundant} robots boomed shortly after. At the time, the term hyper-redundancy -- being an extension to redundancy in robotics \cite{MerriamWebster1983} -- was defined as the relative degree of kinematic and/or actuator redundancy which is large or even infinite \cite{Chirikjian1992,Chirikjian1994}. The term was first introduced by Chirikjian and Burdick (1989, \cite{Chirikjian1989}). Others referred to these robots as \textit{highly redundant} \cite{Wilson1988Dec,Naccarato1989Dec} or \textit{High Degree-of-Freedom} (HDOF) manipulator \cite{Salerno1989Jan,Mochiyama1999}. Around that time, Chirikjian and Burdick provided a plenary of mathematical foundation \cite{Chirikjian1994,Chirikjian1994Jun,Chirikjian1991,Chirikjian1992,Chirikjian1992Dec} focussed on the kinematics and motion planning of hyper-redundant manipulators. Their work presented a modal discretization approach to describe the shape of the deformable backbone \cite{Chirikjian1994Jun}, and from this geometric approaches were introduced to solve obstacle avoiding trajectories using generalized \textit{follow-the-leader} strategies \cite{Chirikjian1992Dec}. Especially the latter showed the limitation in rigid redundant manipulators. Although Chirikjian laid the foundation for the control of hyper-redundant robot, basic principles of motion planning in pneumatic hyper-redundant robots were already presented by Wilson et al. (1988, \cite{Wilson1988Dec,Wilson1989Jun}) -- yet were not called hyper-redundant robots nor soft robots yet. Recall also that the work of Wilson et al. has been sown earlier in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline} and Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_srm_robot}. In Brock et al. (1991, \cite{Brock1991}), a similar analysis was used for optimal shape design of thin elastic rods to realize desired robotic compliance. Besides, there exist an abundance of literature prior to \cite{Chirikjian1992} on Variable Geometry Truss Manipulators (VGTMs) -- a variant of hyper-redundant tensegrity robotics -- that dealt with motion planning for such systems \cite{Naccarato1989Dec,Naccarato1991Apr,Salerno1989Jan}. Later, Mochiyama et al. \cite{Mochiyama1998,Mochiyama1999}, built upon Chirikjian's work by extending it to a dynamic formulation for elastic rods such that classic controller design is possible. They proposed shape-regulation controllers for HDOF manipulator by projecting them onto time-invariant curves, thereby showing that the estimation the desired curve parameters is the crucial key to solving the problem by Lyapunov design \cite{Mochiyama1998}. Although there existed a variety of modeling and control strategies, computational power in relation to modeling complexity was the limiting factor for the simulation-to-reality transfer at the time.
