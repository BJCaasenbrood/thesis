\section{History of soft robotics: what are they?} 
\label{sec:intro:history}
% https://cyberneticzoo.com/bionics/1957-artificial-muscle-joseph-laws-mckibben-american/
The term \emph{soft robotics} is the abbreviated form of \emph{soft material robotics}. \textit{Soft} or \textit{softness}  here refers to the enveloping properties of low-elasticity materials. Examples include: high compressibility, low rigidity, high structural damping, and (often) environmental resilience. An objective measure of a material's elasticity is the Young's modulus. Although it only applies to homogenous media that are subjected to axial loads and small deformations, it can be explored to classify the rigidity of materials. We provided a spectrum of different materials in Figure \ref{fig:C0:elasticity}. Observing the spectrum, we observe that convectional materials used in \textit{rigid} robotics (like metals and hard plastics) have elasticity moduli in the order of $10^9 - 10^{12}$ \si{Pa}. Yet, biological organisms are composed of materials with predominantly low moduli $10^4 - 10^7$ \si{Pa} (\eg, muscle tissue) and sparse high moduli $10^8 - 10^9$ \si{Pa} (\eg, bone). It is interesting to observe that the materials responsible for motion, which naturally undergo repeated deformation, have accordingly low elasticity. As opposed to the use of rigid materials in classic robotics. The idea of exploring low elasticity materials in robotics, so-called \emph{soft materials}, has sparked a new directions in robotics research aimed at harmonizing robotics and biology. 

Now, although the words \emph{soft} and \emph{robotics} have a clear definitions independently, the collocation of the two sparked many vivid discussions and new idealogies within the robotics community for the past decades. Throughout its young academic life, several defintions have been coined. Early terms for soft robotics were used to indicate robots with variable joint stiffness \cite{AlbuSchaffer2004}, or robots with artificial compliance using control \cite{AlbuSchaffer2011}. The term was also used to underline the shift from rigid-linked robots to bio-inspired continuum robots with \textit{inherently compliant and exhibit large strains in normal operations} \cite{Trivedi2008}. Paraphrasing the work of Robison et al. (1999, \cite{Robinson1999}): \textit{soft robotic manipulators are continuum robots made of soft materials that undergo continuous elastic deformation and produce motion through the generation of a smooth backbone curve}. Alternatively, a broader definition was coined in a review by Kim et al. (\cite{Kim2013}, 2013) simply referring to soft-bodied robots as \textit{an analogy to soft-bodied animals}. A concise (but perhaps too general) definition was proposed by Laschi et al. (\cite{Laschi2014}, 2014), as soft robots being \textit{any robot built by soft materials}. Rus et al. (2015, \cite{Rus2015}) defined soft robots in terms of their structural elasticity: \textit{Systems that are capable of autonomous behavior, and that are primarily composed of materials with moduli in the range of that of soft biological materials}.

%Consequently, the exponentially increasing scientific interest in soft robotics that boomed in the early 2010s, which may be seen as a historical cornerstone that has revolutionized our perspective on the branching field of robotics as a whole.
Although the debate on its exact terminology is still ongoing, and perhaps may never be closed; we will propose  soft robotics terminologies and related topics in the field based an ensemble of soft robotic history and literature. Naturally, given its multi-disciplinary extensiveness, the terms used in this thesis will deviate from the aforementioned literature. Yet, introducing these defintions is deemed necessary to mitigate ambiguity in this thesis. Following, let us propose a definition for soft robotics:
%
\terminology{\textbf{Soft robotics} is a robotics subclass with purposefully designed compliant elements embedded into their mechanical structure whose goal is to endow the robot with natural (or biological) motion or compliance.}{}
%
This definition is adopted from the work of Della Santina et al. (2020, \cite{DellaSantina2020Springer}), but modified to highlight the importance of soft materials to mimic biological motion -- also referred to as \emph{bio-mimicry}. The ambition of closely mimicking biological creatures is perhaps not commonly associated with the field of robotics, given its importance in the automation industry, yet the inception of robotics can originally be found in bio-mimicry when regarding its rich history. We would like to invite the reader to embark with us a brief section into a short history of soft robotics. Hereby showing that the current trends of bio-mimicry and elasticity in robotics find roots in a periods way before the soft robotic boom in the early 2010's. To guide the reader, in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}, we provide a historical overview of soft robotic systems. We will discuss the inception of bio-mimicry in robotics, flexibility in robotics and early soft robots.

%\textbf{(Biomimicry in early automata)} One of the earliest examples of bio-mimicry is a mechanical wooden dove developed by mathematician Archytas of Tarentum in 350 BC. According to historians, the system was driven by compressed air or an internal steam-driven engine to achieve forward propulsion. It was believed to achieve traveling distances of ~200 \si{\meter} (see note\footnote{It was unclear if the devices was attached to a rope, or autonomous flight was achieved.}). Although might argue its lacks to sophistication to be considered a \emph{robot}, Archytas's invention could be considered as one of the earliest examples aviation, as its mechanical principles of achieving motion are undoubtedly similar to nowadays \emph{drone} technology. A millennium later, in the period of the High Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci designed and constructed a mechanical knight around the 1490's -- and is thought to be the earliest robotic system. The mechanical constructions are perhaps closer to classical robots given our current perspective, and it was capable of various complex motions using preprogrammed sequences. 
%It is well-known that his work was built upon extensive anatomical research, which may have facilitated a deep understanding of the human body into the mechanical knight's robotic design. Given the work of Archytas and Da Vinci, biomimicry played a paramount role in the development of robot technologies before the term \emph{robot} was even introduced.

%\par In the 1920's, shortly after the second industrial revolution (1870 - 1914) and the first world war (1914), the first usage of the work \emph{robot} appeared -- originally meaning 'forced labor by serfs' (\ie, peasants) derived from the Czech word \emph{robota}. An common misconception is that robot implies slave, nonetheless, its origin is somewhat related. The word was popularized by Karel \v{C}apek in his play R.U.R. (Rossumâ€™s Universal Robots) that involves an inventor named Rossum who discovers the secret of creating human-like machines. In his play, Rossom's robots assisted or fully alleviated mankind from any labor. Through human's ambition to assimilate man and machine, the robots ultimately gained the capacity for emotions. Shortly after, the robots, who were created to serve humans, have come to dominate mankind completely. The word \emph{robotics} was later solidified by Isaac Asimov, adapting the term from \v{C}apek. These works of science fiction are perhaps the fundamental groundwork of modern robotics which have led to the base practices of robotics and its corresponding academic field.

(\textbf{Early robots with flexibility}) Before discussing robotic systems with flexibility, let us begin with the early rigid robotics. In 1954, George Devol filed a patent describing an autonomous robotic machine that could be preprogrammed to execute step-by-step motions \cite{Mickle2008}. The machine was designed to reduce the workload on the manufacturing work floor, with a major focus on mimicking repetitive, exhausting human labor. In 1958, those prototypes led to a robotic system under the name \emph{Unimate}. The Unimate was used for manipulating metal die-casts and welding these to the main body of automobiles. In doing so revolutionizing the car industry shortly after. Much later (1969), Victor Scheinman created the Stanford Arm, recognized as the first electronic computer-controlled robotic arm because the Unimate's instructions (\ie, setpoints) were stored on a magnetic drum. He later developed the PUMA robot in 1972 -- the successor of the Unimate. Please keep Scheinman in mind, as he ultimately ties to early soft robots. \vspace{0.085em}


Nearly four years after the Unimate was developed, Joseph L. McKibben developed a pneumatic muscle-inspired actuator capable of linear contraction -- called the McKibben actuator. The McKibben muscle is a type of Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) which is to this date the most frequently used and published artificial muscle in literature. According to \cite{Mckibben}, he developed the McKibben actuators to bring motion to his little daughter's polio-paralyzed hand. His aim was that eventually these pneumatic actuators may help patients with paralyzed fingers to move, to grasp, and even to write. Inspired by the human muscle, the McKibben actuator consists of an inflatable inner bladder enveloped with a double-helical weave. When pressurized, the fluidic actuator converts radial expansion into uni-axial contraction \cite{Daerden1999,Daerden2000,Schulte1961} since weave inhibits extensive \emph{ballooning} -- a term for undesired rapidly-accelerated volumetric expansion. The materials are typically latex or silicone rubber with nylon fibers. A schematic representation of a general pneumatic muscle and the effect of ballooning are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}. Ballooning is an (often undesired) nonlinear effect, where the hyper-elastic pressure vessel exhibits strain-softening after a critical point is reached. As a result, further increase of the pressure leads to an exponential growth in volume, which ultimately leads to actuator tearing. At stages of ballooning, mechanical performance significantly drops and even produces adverse effects, like actuation reversal. McKibben solved this problem through a combination of soft and inextensible fiber weaves. These inextensible were placed at the exterior wall of the soft muscle, thereby limiting the radial expansion before ballooning could occur. According to Daerden (1999, \cite{Daerden1999}), there a many variations of pneumatic muscle besides braided muscles, such as the \emph{netted muscles} (e.g, Yarlott \cite{Yarlott1972}, ROMAC \cite{Immega1986}, and Kukolj \cite{Kukolj1988}) and \emph{embedded muscles} (\eg, Morin \cite{Morin1953}, Paynter Hyperboloid \cite{Paynter1988}). Illustration of their patent schematics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:several_PAM}.

Pneumatic muscles are perhaps one of the first fundamental technologies that enabled soft robotics and to this day it remains a framework for many soft robotic systems. Nevertheless, besides the many examples of fluidics \cite{Marchese2014,Marchese2016,Katzschmann2018,Suzumori1991,Mosadegh2014}, there exist many other technologies employed in soft robotic motion: such as thermal \cite{Wu2021Dec} or chemical expansion/contraction \cite{Tolley2014,Bartlett2015,Wehner2016}, crystal re-alignment \cite{Pilz2020,Lopez2018,Vantomme2021,Polygerinos2013}, di-electric elastomers \cite{Keplinger2011}, magnetism \cite{Roh2019Apr,KimYoonho2018,McDonald2020,Boyvat2017Jul}, and naturally the use of tendons paired with electro-mechanical actuation \cite{Renda2018,Bern2019,Kim2020Jun,Coevoet2017Feb,Wang2016Sep}. Some predate the invention of the McKibben actuator. An early example of popular actuation techniques in soft robotics is the Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEA) developed by R\"{o}ntgen in (1880, \cite{Rontgen1880}). Therefore, given the abundance of soft robotic actuation, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of soft actuation technology. Although these systems are not categorized as soft robots, they are; however, categorized as soft actuators. We like to emphasize here the difference between soft actuators and soft robots in view of a terminology relevant to the thesis:

\terminology{\textbf{Soft actuators} are controllable flexible actuation units of the constitute soft robot that through external stimuli allow for controllable motion, or change in compliance or texture. }{}
%
%
\begin{rmk} The terminology above attempts to address an ambiguity common to soft robotics, namely the interchangeable use of soft actuator and soft robot. 
\end{rmk}
  %Let us also introduce the dual of soft actuators -- namely the \emph{soft sensor} that relate measurements to the motion of soft actuators:

Returning to 1965, nearly a decade after the invention of the McKibben actuator, Scheinman and Leifer proposed an {novel} pneumatic robotic arm named the \emph{Orm} -- Norwegian for snake (recall that he also developed the popular PUMA robots). Clearly the name was inspired by the morphology of snakes, but it was also an abbreviation for Object-Relational Mapping tool \cite{Corke2020}. To the author's knowledge, this is believed to be the first soft robot. Surprisingly the system predates any rigid, redundant, snake-like robot, like the Scripps tensor arm by Anderson (1968, \cite{Anderson1968}). Similar to the anatomy of the snakes, the system featured 28 rubber pneumatic artificial muscle (\ie, bellows) distributed along the backbone (\ie, skeletal support) of the robot. The network of artificial muscles were sandwiched between steel plates to prevent misalignment. Note that this technology is analogous the pneumatic muscles of McKibben, where a fiber weave was used to prevent ballooning. Yet, contrary to a single McKibben actuator, the soft robotic system could undergo three-dimensional movement by inflation or deflation of embedded pneumatic network. This led to a rich set of movements previously unseen in rigid robotics. As an illustrative example, we provided the mechanics of the Orm soft robot in Figure \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}. The soft robot could achieve bending in any preferred direction by differential pressurization of each channel, and elongation through synchronized actuation. Most notably, comparing the volume vs. strain response of the Orm w.r.t the McKibben actuator, \ie. Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben} against \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}, the actuation response is noticeably more linear. Although not documented at the time, the comparison highlights the importance of structural geometry in pneumatic networks.

By actuation of the pneumatic network, both elongation and bending are achievable. Observe that the response is significantly more linear than McKibben actuators in Fig. \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}, emphasizing the importance of geometry.

\end{figure}

Nevertheless, according to \cite{}, the positional accuracy of the system was poor, yet the concept of pneumatically-driven soft arms has continued. The positional inaccuracy of pneumatic soft actuators at the time may have caused a lost of academic interest in the 60s - 70s. Yet, three years later, in 1968, an improved hyper-redundant robot manipulator was proposed and patented by Anderson and Horn \cite{Anderson1968}.  Improving upon the Orm, which was deemed slow and had limited positional accuracy, Anderson proposed an array of nylon tendons that were connected to rigid discs distributed along the redundant backbone of the robot. The configurable backbone was comprised of universal spherical joints that allow for pivoting motion with respect to other discs -- totalling 16 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs) in the system. The entire arm was actuated hydraulically, yet the actuators were placed outside the robot's body rather than placed at each joint, like the Orm. To improve positional accuracy further, Anderson placed sensor tendons parallel the actuator tendons which allowed for operator position feedback. Although Anderson's robot does not categorize as a soft robot since it relies mostly on rigid materials, its flexibility arose from the thin nylon tendons that were used for both actuation and sensing. Anderson showed that a network of distributed sensors are necessary to describe and control the complex morphology of the robotics system, while mitigating the sensor's effect on the mobility.

\terminology{\textbf{(Proprioceptive) soft sensors} are flexible measurements units embedded into soft robotic system that through external stimuli measure the (local) changes of the system. Softness here implies that the sensor minimally alters the mechanical behavior of the full robotic system.}{}
%
\begin{rmk}
  \vspace{-5mm}
As the emphasize lies on "minimally alters the mechanical behavior of the robot", soft sensors may be composed of stiff (perhaps even rigid) components. Our definition infers that these sensors must be placed into or onto the soft body, minimally affecting the compliance of the soft actuator network in static or dynamic conditions.

(\textbf{Soft robotics in academia})
The exact date of the academic boom of soft robotics is unclear, but it is believed to be the late 2000's. To motivate the argument, we have provided a graph of scientific publications on the topic \textit{soft robot(s)} from 1980 till 2022 (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:publicationhistory}). It shows the cumulative number of publications related to the term soft robot in the title, keywords, or abstract. We also provided related topics to soft robotics, such as '\textit{soft actuators}' and '\textit{flexible}' and '\textit{redundant robot(s)}'. The publication data from Figure \ref{fig:C0:publicationhistory} is obtained using the Web of Sciences data repository.
