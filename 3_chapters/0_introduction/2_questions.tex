The exact date of the academic boom of soft robotics is unclear, but it is believed to be the mid 2000's. To motivate the argument, we have provided a graph of scientific publications on the topic \textit{soft robot(s)} from 1980 till 2022 (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:publicationhistory}). It shows the cumulative number of publications related to the term soft robot in the titles, keywords, and abstracts. The publication data from Figure \ref{fig:C0:publicationhistory} is obtained using the Web of Sciences data repository. Let it be clear that the term \textit{soft robot} was introduced decades after hyper-redundant robots, thus some older academic work might be lost simply due to different terminology. Hence, we also provided related topics such as '\textit{flexible}' and '\textit{redundant robot(s)}'. In the following section, we will discuss modern trends and challenges in the field of soft robotics, that continue the research paths of highly-flexible robots in early 90's.

\begin{rmk}In retrospect to the previous section, soft robotics is an extensive and diverse academic field since early 90's and it has been growing ever since. Given its vastness, we will limit our scope here. Within the upcoming introductory material, we will primarily focus on topics related to: $(i)$ categories in soft robotics, \eg, soft grippers and manipulators, $(ii)$ design and fabrication of fluidic soft actuators, and $(iii)$ modelling and control for the soft manipulator subclass.

\subsection{Labelling of soft robotic systems}
In the past two decades, soft robotics has undergone an evolutionary-like transformation alike biological systems. In this section, we humbly attempt to  categorize some soft robotic systems. 

\textbf{Soft grippers}. Although the origin of soft robots might stem from manipulators, modern soft robotics is perhaps most known for its diversity in soft grippers. Many systems explore redundancy and adaptability in grasping -- and its subsequent manipulation of objects of various sizes, densities, compliance, and fragility. This subfield is a direct response to the hurdles in rigid robotics, where sensory force feedback and strict control laws are necessary for simultaneous safe and firm grasping. Soft grippers, on the other hand, have the natural advantage of adapting to shape and compliance of objects without the need for advanced controllers. Recalling the work of Suzumori et al. \cite{Suzumori1991,Suzumori1992} and earlier the work of Teleshev \cite{Teleshev1981}, many soft grippers explore pneumatics or hydraulics for joint motion. These inherently under-actuated soft grippers, often composed of silicone with embedded pneumatic, have shown impressive adaptability and dexterity in recent years \cite{Ilievski2011Feb,Deimel2015Aug}. Galloway et al. (2016, \cite{Galloway2016}) developed an underwater soft gripper to delicately manipulate and sample fragile species on the deep reef (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:typesofrobots}a). Their deep-reef grippers are inspired by the PneuNet actuators from Mosadegh et al. (2014, \cite{Mosadegh2014}). Li et al. (2017, \cite{Li2017Dec}) developed enveloping soft grippers by combining collapsible origami structures enveloped in flexible skin. Hong et al. (2022, \cite{Hong2022Jan}) explored kirigami soft grippers, delicate enough to handle the yolk of an egg. Others explore electro-adhesive soft grippers, like Shintake et al. (2016, \cite{Shintake2016Jan}) and Dadkhah et al. (2016, \cite{Dadkhah2016}), that can manipulate an unprecedented range of object types. By far, these systems have matured the most, even employing the technology in many industrial and commercial applications \cite{Labs2021Jul,Ansari2022Sep}.

\par \textbf{Soft continuum manipulators}. Following soft grippers, soft continuum manipulators are the soft-equivalent of rigid continuum manipulators. Building upon their predecessors \cite{Webster2010,Rucker2011Jul,Anderson1967,BurgnerKahrs2015Nov}, soft continuum manipulators are a class of hyper-redundant manipulators composed of mostly soft materials with virtually infinite DOFs. Let it be clear that not all continuum manipulator are necessarily soft. It has been a study prior to soft robotics \cite{Chirikjian1992,Chirikjian1994,Robinson1999}. For example, Cieslak and Morecki (1999, \cite{Cieslak1999}) developed an elastic elephant trunk manipulator composed of coil-shaped elastic elements as a deformable backbone. Rucker et al. (2011, \cite{Rucker2011Jul}) developed a semi-rigid continuum robot actuated by tendons. On the other hand, examples of truly soft manipulators included the work of Pritts and Rahn (2004, \cite{Pritts2004}), Marchese and Rus (2015, \cite{Marchese2015}) and their follow-up work (2015, \cite{Marchese2016}). Note that the aforementioned soft manipulators had limited embedded sensing, and many systems preferred fluidic or pneumatic actuation over tendon systems --  a modern take on PAM robotics in the early 70's-80's. In response, Katzschmann et al. (2019, \cite{Katzschmann2019}) proposed a pneumatic soft manipulator with optical markers for model-based feedback control. Following their work, Toshimitsu et al. (2021, \cite{Toshimitsu2021Sep}) developed a soft robotic arm with proprioceptive sensors which explored capacitive flex sensor -- called \textit{SoPrA} (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:typesofrobots}c). Paired with robust analytical model, their system allowed for the measurement of external forces acting on the manipulator. Mitchell et al. (2019, \cite{Mitchell2019}) proposed a soft manipulator build from hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators with muscle-like performance. Besides their incredible high-actuation speeds ($>$100 \si{\hertz}) -- that are difficult to achieve for any fluidic or tendon alternative -- HASEL are intrinsically self-sensing. Coevoet et al. \cite{Coevoet2017Feb} developed a soft continuum manipulator actuated by tendons. As for sensing, the tendon forces are fed into an inverse Finite Element Model (FEM) to compute the deformation accordingly. Given the rich extent of rigid manipulators in classical control; its soft counterpart has become a well-known topic within recent control-oriented research \cite{DellaSantina2021}. 

\par \textbf{Soft mobile robots}. Due to the robustness of soft materials, the technology offers several advantages in terrestrial and aquatic locomotion. A popular example of terrestrial locomotion is the soft quadruped crawler by Shepherd et al. (2011, \cite{Shepherd2011Dec}). An illustation of their system can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}. Their system proposed a configuration of four PneuNets (as legs) connected to a central soft PneuNet body. Through a periodic sequence of pneumatic activation, soft-bodied locomotion is achieved with relative ease. A similar yet improved approach is followed by Tolley et al. (2014, \cite{Tolley2014Sep}) which presented a fully untethered 0.65 meter long mobile soft robot. Dortman et al. (2017, \cite{Drotman2017}) 3D-printed a soft robot with bellowed compliant legs that added more mobility by enabling yaw-pitch rotation. Katzschmann et al. (2018, \cite{Katzschmann2018}) developed a fully-autonomous soft robotic fish suited for aquatic exploration.

\textbf{Soft cyborgs}. The term \textit{soft cyborgs} is a recent development in the field of soft robotics that relates to a subclass fully composed of biological material \cite{Rus2015}. An example is the popular work by Kriegman et al. (2019, \cite{Kriegman2019}) which produced a \textit{living organic} robot made from frog skin and muscle cells. They named these robots \textit{Xenobots} after the origin of the biological tissue -- the \textit{Xenopus laevis} frog. Not only are these system capable of autonomous locomotion, recent studies show that these systems are fully capable of artificial (self)-reproduction \cite{Kriegman2021Dec}. Other examples of bio-engineered soft robots are \cite{Ieropoulos2009Apr,Nawroth2012Aug}. To this day, these systems stand the furthest apart from any classic robotics, and maybe seen as a successful attempt at filling the fringes between machine and nature.

\subsection{Tailoring design of fluidic soft actuation}
As the name soft robots arises from its use of soft materials, it follows that design and fabrication using soft materials play a huge role in their technological development. Contrary to rigid robots, many soft robots explore whole body movement rather than localized regions undergoing motion -- called \textit{joints}. In classic robotics, robots are composed of a countable number of rigid links and joints \cite{Spong2006,Murray1994,Corke2011}, either arranged in series or parallel. Together they span a workable range of motion called the \textit{workspace} \cite{Spong2006}. Focussing on rigid manipulators, whose base is often structurally fixated, their workspace can be obtained through a system of kinematics, often derived through a set of geometrical equalities. Rigid manipulators often have a bounded workspace (assuming actuation limits). In robotic locomotion, similar kinematic descriptions can be obtained for the legs and feet, with the exception of an additional free-floating base. In these cases, however, the workspace is of less interest, rather the different possibility of \textit{gait cycles} that arise from the link-joint configuration and actuator dynamics determine system's success for locomotion. 

%However, contrary to manipulators, an additional global free-floating frame is introduced (\eg, a coordinate frame at the center of mass) that describe the global coordinates of the full robotic body. As such, for robotic locomotion, the workspaces are often unbounded and thus carry less importance. Nonetheless, their structural layout of joints and links play a crucial role in energy consumption. High efficiency in the cyclic exchange in potential and kinetic energy is hugely beneficial to the duration of locomotion. In any case, either manipulators and locomotion machines, the topological layout of the links and joints are of paramount importance.
Returning to soft robots, 
the definitions such as {joints}, {workspace} and {gait cycles} also apply here. Yet, the high flexibility allows for many non-restricted joint displacements which make deriving closed-form mathematical descriptions challenging. The shape of workspace and locomotion patterns are majorly influenced by geometry of the soft actuator, its flexibility modes, and how forces are transferred with the continuum soft body. Controlling the motion within soft actuation -- so to speak reducing parasitic mobility and tailoring motion based on structural geometry -- is an active topic in soft robotics research for decades. \\

\textbf{Engineering principles in fluidic soft actuators}. In the past decade, researchers have developed various techniques of exploiting the high-elasticity of soft materials for \textit{controllable} actuation. One key development, similar working principles to the pneumatic muscle groups (see \cite{Mckibben,Morin1953} or Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}), are Soft Pneumatic Actuators (SPAs). A few examples are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:actuationtypes}. SPAs undergo similar mechanics akin to McKibben actuators \cite{Mckibben} or Morin actuators \cite{Morin1953}, yet they envelop a diverse collection of motion besides uniaxial. Examples include: contraction and elongation \cite{Yang2016}, axial growth \cite{Hawkes2017}, bending \cite{Mosadegh2014,Galloway2016,Marchese2016}, helical and twisting, and a hybridization of all the aforementioned motions. An example of soft actuators capable of contraction is the Vacuum-Actuated Muscle-inspired Pneumatic (VAMP) structures by Yang et al. (2016, \cite{Yang2016}). Their work proposes a tailored geometrical structure embedded into a soft elastomer medium that is highly sensitive towards buckling. When subjected to a sufficiently large negative differential pressure, the internal structure undergoes a (reversible) mechanically instable leading to uniaxial contraction, we see in Figure \ref{fig:C0:actuationtypes}. Their work is inspired by a similar buckling behavior of patterned elastomer \cite{Bertoldi2008,Mullin2007,Shim2013Aug} subjected to axial loads. These muscle-inspired vacuum soft actuators are fast, produce a stable, repeatable motion; and more importantly, explore structural geometry to reduce parasitic motion. An example of soft bending actuators is the FLIP-FLOP system \cite{Cianchetti2013Nov}. Akin the ORM system \cite{BibEntryOrm2019Sep}, it has three pressure chambers embedded into a soft cylindrical-shaped elastomer. To prevent ballooning, inextensible rings are placed orthogonal to the deformable backbone. It design is also reminiscent of \cite{Suzumori1992,Suzumori1991}. Hawkes et al. (2017, \cite{Hawkes2017}) developed a soft manipulator inspired by the growing behavior of vines. Kim et al. (2019, \cite{Kim2019Aug}) used laminates that adhere to the volumetrically expanding soft body as to govern the motion trajectory through bending and twisting.

\textbf{Exploring optimization and evolutionary algorithms}. Besides design through engineering principles, optimization in soft robotics is slowly gaining momentum recent years. Wang et al. (2020, \cite{Wang2020Nov}) used a topology optimization to find the optimal design for a cable-driven soft gripper (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}a). Similarly, Tian et al. (2020, \cite{Tian2020May}) explored topology optimization for ferro-magnetic soft grippers. Besides soft grippers, evolutionary design algorithms are also employed for soft mobile like crawler and swimmers. Joachimczak et al. (2015, \cite{Joachimczak2014Jul,Joachimczak2015}) explored evolutionary search algorithm with the purpose of automatically designing complex morphologies and controllers of multi-cellular, soft-bodied robots (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}c). Hu et al. (2019, \cite{Hu2019taichi}) used a differential physics simulator called \texttt{DiffTachi} that efficiently computes gradient information for each simulation timestep. The gradient information can then be fed into neural network controllers to solve, for instance, the appropriate gait-cycles required in the locomotion of soft-bodied crawlers (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}d).

\subsection{Gaining performance through modelling and control}
\label{sec:C0:modelcontrol}
As the inherent properties in soft materials bring forth many benefits, \eg, adaptability, hyper-redundancy, and passivity w.r.t. the environment; it too hinders the progress in model-based controllers. Earlier, we have touched upon these subject with the rise of kinematic and dynamic models for hyper-redundant robotics in the late 80's -- early 90's. Chirikjian et al. (1992, \cite{Chirikjian1992}) provided a kinematic framework for hyper-redundant manipulators with application to motion planning (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}a). Here the elastic backbone is approximated using a modal formulation. Such modeling framework are one-to-one transferable to soft continuum manipulators. Mochiyama et al. (1998, \cite{Mochiyama1998,Mochiyama2003}) extended this work to a dynamics formulation -- even providing Lyapunov-based control strategies for shape regulations (Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}b). However, both modeling frameworks were computationally inefficient -- lacking transferability to real-time control. The root problem stems from the fact that soft continuum robots, belonging in their exact formulation to the field of continuum mechanics, lead to infinite-dimensional models often expressed as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Rigid multi-body systems, like robot manipulators or mobile robots on the other hand, have convenient Ordinary Differential Equation (ODEs) structures as they are rooted in Lagrangian or Newtonian mechanical principles. Rigid-body models were (and still are) fast computationally and their literature on controller design is vast and well-established \cite{Murray1994,Corke2011,Spong2006}. The computational issues in early continuum robots may be reflected by its literature gap between the 1990's to 2010's.

\textbf{Modern control-oriented models for soft robots}. In the past decade, significant steps have been made to address the issues of infinite dimensionality \cite{DellaSantina2021}. The key is to formulate a finite-dimensional approximation of the soft robot's dynamic such that they can be written as standard ODEs. Reduced-Order Models -- ROM for short -- have paved the path of model-based controller for soft robots whose reduced formulations are both tractable and precise. In the years shortly after its academic boom, many different assumptions and model approximations have come forth to address the issue of control.

\begin{rmk}
A majority of the reduced-order formulations for soft robotics are only applicable to slender robots. Consequently, soft robot manipulators have become the main subject for many control-oriented studies. This scope reduction is well-motivated however as many soft robots have one physical dimension that is more dominant than the other two \cite{DellaSantina2021}. As such, the thesis focusses majorly on modeling and control of soft manipulators rather than a broader scope.
\end{rmk}
%
\par 
Focussing on soft robot manipulators first, a popular choice of finite-dimensional reduction is the so-called \textit{Piecewise Constant Curvature} (PCC) soft beam model. 
The PCC modeling approach is by far the most adopted in the soft robotics community \cite{Webster2010}. As the name implies, the soft robot is modelled as an elastically deformable beam with all strains but curvature neglected. Examples of this approximation include \cite{Falkenhahn2015,Marchese2016,Katzschmann2018,Katzschmann2019,Runge2017,Franco2020,Webster2010,DellaSantina2020a}. Highlighting a few, Katzschmann et al. (2018, \cite{Katzschmann2018}) proposed to connect the PCC formulation to an augmented rigid robot dynamical model with parallel elastic actuation (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}c). A similar approach was proposed earlier by Falkenhanh et al. (2015, \cite{Falkenhahn2015}) and applied to Festo's bionic arm \cite{Grzesiak2011}. Although such lumped models may seem like a major over-simplification, the proposed model allows sufficient speed and accuracy such that model-based feedback is applicable. This formulation was also employed later in an adaptive sliding mode control scheme \cite{Kazemipour2022May} for the SoPra soft arm \cite{Toshimitsu2021Sep}. Following, Renda et al. (2018, \cite{Renda2018}) extended the PCC model to \textit{Piecewise Constant Strain} (PCS) formulation. This formulation allowed for all strain if and only if considered spatially piece-wise constant (Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}d). Rooted in $\SE{3}$ geometry of the Cosserat approach \cite{Simo1986}, it provided a closer relation with the rigid body geometry of the traditional robotics. The formulation also extends to soft manipulators with fluidic actuation \cite{Renda2017Aug, Till2019} The PCS model was later employed to feedforward controllers by Thuruthel et al. (2018, \cite{Thuruthel2018Nov}) using model-based policy learning algorithms. To improve efficiency, a recurrent neural network was trained using an offline PCS model. Grazioso et al. (2019, \cite{Grazioso2019}) explored a similar path of geometric Cosserat beams using helical strain functions. Nevertheless, Constant Strain (CS) models have severe limitations. They often do not originate from continuum mechanics and thus are only applicable in restrictive settings. Although computationally performance might surpass continuous models, due to intrinsic kinematic restrictions, they are unable to capture important continuum phenomena, like buckling, environmental interaction, or wave propagation.

In response to its limitation, many researchers continued their search for efficient and more generalizable alternative. Della Santina et al. (2020, \cite{DellaSantina2020}) proposed a polynomial description to described the continuum dynamics, a description analogous to \cite{Chirikjian1992}. In their work, they expressed the curvature function of the soft robot in terms of a standard polynomial bases. Not only can an exact infinite dimensional formulation of the problem be obtained (in theory), truncation at any level is changed easily. The technique is also widely used for flexible-link robot manipulators to capture small vibrations, see DeLuca et al. (2016, \cite{DeLuca2016Jul}). Della Santina et al. also showed that PCC-rooted assumptions as control output produce a minimum phase system \cite{DellaSantina2020} -- a fundamental stepping-stone for nonlinear control. Following, Boyer et al. (2021, \cite{Boyer2021}) extended upon their prior Cosserat models \cite{Renda2018,Renda2020}, and presented a tractable and generalizable beam model for slender soft manipulators. A similar approach to \cite{DellaSantina2020} was followed but all strains are discretized using a finite set of strain basis functions. Renda et al. (2020, \cite{Renda2020}) improved computation by introducing a two-stage Gauss quadrature \cite{Zanna1999} to derive the Magnus expansion \cite{Hairer2002}. Other examples of the Cosserat beam descriptions, but more focussed on the continuum mechanics rather than control, is the work Gazzola et al. (2018, \cite{Gazzola2018}). Their work allowed for efficient Cosserat beam models suitable for self-collision, thus providing various simulation for twirling and coiling of beams under increasing torsional loads.

Another popular alternative, better suited for general soft robotic systems like soft mobile robots, are reduced-order finite element models \cite{Duriez2013,Coevoet2017,Coevoet2017Feb,Goury2018,Thieffry2017,Thieffry2020,Tonkens2021May,Katzschmann2019Apr,Wu2021Feb,Zhang2017} or neural-network trained using offline FEM simulations \cite{Fang2020Dec}. Starting from high-order FEM data (\eg, state dimensions of the order $10$k) that capture the whole workspace spanned by the network of soft actuators, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques are employed to drastically to reduce the state dimension of the soft robot model. These techniques can even retain external loads (\eg, contact and friction) with precision as long as they are included in the offline data set \cite{Goury2018}. By far, this FEM-driven method has shown the most success in the experimental control regime. 

\textbf{Soft robot simulation and programming environments}. 
%
The rapid development of soft robotic models in recent years have also increased the demand for (open-access) software packages. Especially since many of the aforementioned ROM models require an advanced level of mathematical understanding. In an attempt to help the soft robotics community, many researchers have provided open-source, documented simulators interwoven in their soft robotics research. A popular FEM-based software on soft robotic modeling and control is \texttt{SOFA} by Duriez et al. (2013, \cite{Duriez2013,Coevoet2017}). \texttt{DiffTachi} by Hu et al. \cite{Hu2019taichi, Hu2019Oct} explores differential simulations to produce soft machine capable of locomotion. Bern et al. (2022, \cite{Bern2022,Bern2019}) developed \texttt{SoftIK}, a software for soft deformable plushy robots. Among beam or rod-based models there exist many options. Examples included \texttt{Elastica} (or \texttt{pyElastica} \cite{Tekinalp2022}) by Gazzola et al. \cite{Gazzola2018,Zhang2019}, \texttt{TMTDyn} by Sadati et al. \cite{Sadati2020}, \texttt{SimSOFT} by Grazioso et al. \cite{Grazioso2019}, and \texttt{SoRoSim} by Mathew et al. \cite{Mathew2021Jul} based on the work of Renda et al. \cite{Renda2020} and Boyer et al. \cite{Boyer2021}. The \texttt{Sorotoki} toolkit by Caasenbrood et al. \cite{SorotokiCode}  -- open-source software package presented as a part of this thesis  -- explores a combination of FEM models and soft beam models. The toolkit written in Matlab aims to bridge the gaps between design, modeling, and control of (hyper-elastic) soft robots.

\textbf{Closing the loop in soft robotics}. Following the many developments in computational efficiency of reduced-order models (and accordingly the advances in soft sensing), academic research in model-based or model-free control for soft robots is significantly growing since early 2019. Note that feedforward controllers for soft manipulators have been proposed years prior, \eg, \cite{Falkenhahn2015May,Falkenhahn2015,Thuruthel2017Oct,Satheeshbabu2019May}. 

By far, experimental validation of PCC model has been used more intensively than other models. In Della Santina et al. (2019. \cite{DellaSantina2020a}, the augmented rigid-body PCC model is used to design a closed-loop controller for a continuous soft manipulator, presenting two architectures designed for dynamic trajectory tracking and surface following. Prior work is provided here \cite{Katzschmann2019}. A similar approach was followed by Milana et al. (2021, \cite{Milana2021Apr}) and applied to an artificial soft cilia. They showed that soft bending actuators could mimic the asymmetric motion of the cilia through model-based control. Cao et al. (2021, \cite{Cao2021Apr}) explored a reduced analytical model \cite{Wang2019Apr}, somewhat equivalent to a linear pendulum model (apart from quadratic terms in the potential force); to develop robust tracking controllers without velocity observers. Their controller was tested experimentally on a soft PneuNet actuator. Wang et al. (2022, \cite{Wang2022Mar}) developed a computed torque controller (see \cite{Spong2006}) using the augmented rigid-body PCC model and applied it to a soft Honeycomb Pneumatic Network Arm \cite{Jiang2016Dec}. Franco et al. (2020, \cite{Franco2020,Franco2020Jan}) used a port-Hamiltonian modeling framework akin to rigid-body PCC model (\ie, three-link pendulum) and applied such principles to energy-shaping controllers. The performance of their controller was assessed via simulations and via experiments on two soft continuum prototypes. On a side note, Franco et al. (2022, \cite{Franco2022May}) also developed an energy-shaping control law together with nonlinear observers for the control of soft growing robots \cite{Hawkes2017} with pneumatic actuation subject to the (ideal) gas laws.

As mentioned previously, the PCC model has significant limitation that impose questions on the useability, dexterity, and robustness of their control derivation. Although majorly focussed on simulation, higher-order dynamics have been used for the development of feedback controller in soft manipulators. Della Santina et al. (\cite{DellaSantina2021}) developed swing-up controllers for a soft pendulum modelled by the affine curvature models (\ie, a polynomial curvature model \cite{DellaSantina2020} of order $k = 2$). Their approach mirrors the path of classic control problem of inverted pendulums in the 90's and early 00's \cite{Spong1996,Spong1996a,Ortega1998,Shiriaev1999Dec}. Later, Weerakoon et al. (2021, \cite{Weerakoon2021Dec}) extended upon their work by introducing a revolute base. A common control problem here is under-actuation \cite{Tedrake2022,Spong2006,Murray1994} -- implying that not all control actions can be realized to steer the configuration space to a desired position. In the work of Borja et al. (2022, \cite{Borja2022Apr}) developed a general control framework that can stabilize soft manipulators based on potential energy shaping based on the affine curvature model. Their work showed that some linear matrix inequalities can be derived based on the gradient of the potential energy related to the passive and active states, such that local stability can be proven. In laymen terms, elasticity must dominate the forces resulting from the gravity in the underactuated states for (potential) energy-shaping controllers (and mostly-like others) to work.
