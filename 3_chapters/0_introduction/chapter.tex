%\introabstract{We begin this thesis with a brief overview of the rich history of soft robotics, and its research topics. During the first part, the reader will be familiarized with the field and terminologies common to the field. We will transition from rigid to soft robotics, highlighting is early inception. Once familaizer with the field, we will discuss its academic roots, related to topics on design, modeling and control strategies.}
