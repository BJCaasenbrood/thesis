\section{Research challenges and contributions}
\contribution{Development of efficient algorithms, applicable to the general design of soft actuators, that solve the inverse design problem: Given a desired morphological motion, what is the according (soft) material distrubution withing the design domain to realize the desired joint motion?}{}
