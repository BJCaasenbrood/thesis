\chapterabstract{
In this chapter, we address some of the limitation of the previous \textit{Piecewise-Constant-Curvature} (PCC) model presented in Chapter 3, in particular the infinite-dimensionality of the soft robot's deformable body. The continuous dynamics of the soft robot are modeled through the differential geometry of Cosserat beams. Contrary to the PCC model, a wide variety of spatial discretization can be used that better respect the spatial continuity and continuum mechanics of the system. Using a finite-dimensional truncation, the infinite-dimensional system can be written as a reduced-order port-Hamiltonian (pH) model that preserves desirable passivity conditions. Then, a model-based controller is introduced that produces a local minimizer of closed-loop potential energy for the desired end-effector configuration. The stabilizing control utilizes an energy-based approach and exploits the passivity of soft robotic system. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated through extensive simulations of various soft manipulators that share a resemblance with biology.}
