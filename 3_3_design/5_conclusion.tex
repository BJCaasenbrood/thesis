\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we present a novel framework for synthesizing soft robot topologies from hyperelastic soft materials. The design synthesis of classic soft robots is challenging due to material nonlinearities and the numerical implementation of pressure-driven loads in a topology optimization framework. We proposed a nonlinear finite element method for polygonal elements to solve these problems. Compared to previous research, our numerical approach presents a better representation of the physical nature of soft robotics, in particular, the hyperelasticity and the pneumatic actuation. Numerical investigation shows that our framework can produce meaningful and insight-full material layouts when developing a pressure-driven soft robot from soft materials. We further establish that the exploration of a range of materials can potentially yield diverse design solutions, including those that are independent of the specific material used. Theoretically, the proposed framework can be adapted to also express other actuation principles in soft robotics, such as dielectric polymers or thermal expansion; however, minor changes are required.
