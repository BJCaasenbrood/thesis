\chapterabstract{In this chapter, we derive continuum dynamic models for pneumatic soft robot manipulators through the differential geometry of spatial curves. These models are then related tothe Finite Element Method (FEM) to capture the intrinsic geometric and material nonlinearities. To accelerate numerical simulation, a reduced-order integration scheme is introduced to compute the dynamic Lagrangian matrices efficiently. This, in turn, allows for high-speed and (multi-link) dynamic models for soft manipulators with a minimal sacrifice in numerical precision. By exploring passivity ideas and a linear parametrization of hyper-elastic material coefficients, we also propose a passivity-based adaptive controller that enhances robustness towards material uncertainty and unmodelled dynamics -- slowly improving their estimates online. As a study case, a fully 3D-printed soft robot manipulator is developed, which shows good correspondence with the dynamic model under various conditions, \eg, natural oscillations, forced inputs, and subjected to external disturbances like tip-loads. The solidity of the approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations, numerical benchmarks, and experimental validations.}
