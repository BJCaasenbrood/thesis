In recent years, the scientific community has shown an increasing interest in soft robotics owing to its utilization of soft materials that augment the dexterity, mobility and resilience of robots. The field has demonstrated potential for various applications in both industrial and academic settings, such as reliable and safe manipulation, adaptable gripping, and environmental exploration under uncertainties. Despite the advancements made in soft robotics, there is still a considerable gap between this field and traditional rigid robotics as well as biological systems. As highlighted in the introduction, successful implementation of embodied intelligence in soft robotics necessitates the holistic consideration of the entire embodiment of the bio-inspired system, which harmonizes design and control aspects of soft robots.

The primary objective of this thesis is to develop new and systematic tools for the design, modeling, and control of soft robots, with the aim of improving their overall performance by considering these aspects as a collective body. In this section, we provide an overview of the key contributions of the thesis, along with recommendations for future research directions.

\section{Conclusions}
% Soft robotics as a scientific field has grown significantly, with 
% In this work, we have developed new tools for the design, modeling, and control of soft robotic systems that aim to  push performance and adaptability of said systems further than previous ad-hoc methods. As discussed in the introduction of the thesis, pushing performance in soft robotics is challenging due to the unpredicedent challenges concerning accurate prediction of soft materials under static or dynamic deformations. This ultimately leads to systems with subpar performance as design and control strategies rely on modeling as the  framework. 
% The main objective of the thesis therefore reads:

% \objective{Development and analysis of new systematic tools balanced between the design, modeling, and control of soft continuum robots, whose goal is to achieve similar performance as rigid robotics and eventually biology.}

% The conclusion of the thesis 
% We acknowledge that there are open subproblems that fall outside the scope of this thesis. Accordingly, we provide recommendations for future research avenues in the concluding section of this dissertation.
% This brings us to the first research questions (R1):

% \begin{center}
% \textit{How do we design fluidic-interacting mechanical structures made from soft materials that deform according to a user-defined morphological pattern?}
% \end{center}

\textbf{Design synthesis of soft actuators. } Chapter \ref{chap: design} of the thesis proposes a new framework for synthesizing soft robot topologies from hyperelastic materials. The optimal design of actively deformable soft structures is a complex task due to the presence of numerous nonlinearities arising from material properties and fluid-structure interactions that result in state-dependent loads. It is crucial to consider these effects when designing such structures, as doing so ensures that the final soft topology is both efficient and effective in meeting its intended motion requirements. Moreover, ad-hoc methods may not always align with the specified objectives of the user, not only because of time constraints but also due to the increasing demand for complex joint coordination in soft robotic systems.

We address the challenges associated with designing fluid-driven soft structures by exploring the nonlinear Finite Element Method (FEM) using polygonal elements in conjunction with gradient-based topology optimization. The presented approach involves numerical free-form optimization to identify optimal topologies for fluidic soft actuation with predefined motion criteria set by the user. By exploring the mesh connectivity and volumetric dilation of polygonal elements, we have demonstrated that our approach provides a precise representation of fluid-structure interactions in soft robots, which is currently lacking in traditional structural optimization techniques. Through numerical analysis, we show that the optimization framework can generate meaningful material compositions that aid in the development of pressure-driven soft robots. An interesting observation is that the optimized topologies align with prevalent design often utilized in soft robotics, including the bellows and the well-known PneuNet actuator. While certain differences may be subtle, they highlight the significance of optimal design in soft robotics. For instance, our method results in concave bellow configurations that efficiently increase the actuator's stroke; or alternatively, the bellows in the PneuNet actuator adopt a tear-shaped form to replace the necessity for an inextensible layer at the base.

\textbf{Modeling for control of soft manipulators.} Chapter \ref{chap:PCC} addresses the necessity of bridging the gap between modeling and control-oriented research in soft robotics. The chapter proposes developing accurate dynamic models for continuum soft robots to explore model-based control. However, such dynamic models tailored towards continuum soft robots must maintain real-time performance for transferring model-based control to physical systems. To achieve this goal, we use a minimal set of coordinates related to the differential geometry of spatial curves to express high-dimensional continuum deformation, building upon existing PCC formulations. To improve computational efficiency further, we propose a reduced-order integration scheme for fast forward dynamic simulations. Through numerical benchmarking, we demonstrate its ability to achieve real-time performance. In this study, we introduce high-fidelity FEM data to enhance the representation of state-dependent compliance resulting from hyperelasticity and structural influence in our models. We also introduce simplified models capable of capturing viscoelastic behavior, specifically creep. Our aim is to offer a more precise depiction of soft robots' compliant nature when compared to conventional Hookean options. To qualitatively evaluate our modifications, we conduct experimental measurements that highlight a significant accuracy improvement for static and dynamic conditions.

The resulting continuum dynamical model shows good correspondence with physical soft robots and enables real-time simulations with various degrees of motion. Due to the similarity in model structure between soft robots and rigid robots, conventional control theory can be utilized. We introduce an adaptive controller that offers excellent tracking performance, even when faced with parameters uncertainties, \eg, material parameters and tip-loads. Moreover, the controller progressively improves the accuracy of these estimations over time, subject to the condition that the unknown parameters are persistently excited.

In Chapter \ref{chap:BeyondPCC}, the focus is on soft robots and their ability to mimic complex morphological motions found in nature. A modeling framework for Cosserat beams is presented, which leads to a finite-dimensional system in a port-Hamiltonian structure. An energy-shaping controller is proposed that ensures the closed-loop Hamiltonian is minimal at the desired set-point. The numerical model is developed for several bio-inspired soft robots, such as an octopus' tentacle and an elephant's trunk, with distributed control inputs. The key challenges are capturing hyper-flexibility, dealing with inherent under-actuation, and exploiting hyper-redundancy to achieve control tasks. The model-based controller yields smooth convergence of the soft robot's end-effector while accounting for under-actuation. It was shown that by tuning the controller gains, the intrinsic stiffness of the soft body can be adapted, resulting in significantly different quasi-static joint solutions of the set-point problem.
%However, there are limitations to this approach, such as the strain parametrization of functional basis not accounting for the geometry of the soft robot, making it difficult to accurately represent true continuum dynamics. Additionally, measuring spatial modes in an experimental setting is challenging, and future research is required to find a suitable 'soft sensing' technique. The proposed controller is suited for set-point regulation or slow-varying references. Overall, the mobility of the Cosserat model paired with energy-based control has a close resemblance to biological motion.

\textbf{Software development for the soft robotics community.} In Chapter \ref{chap:Sorotoki}, the thesis presents \texttt{Sorotoki}, an MATLAB toolkit that provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment for the design, modeling, and control of soft robots; and  serves as a collection of all prior material presented in the dissertation. The toolkit consists of a library of Object-Oriented classes designed to solve a wide range of problems in the field of soft robotics, including inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and shape estimation. Most notably is its ability to succinctly represent complex soft robotics systems with minimal code, makes it highly accessible towards individuals with limited programming knowledge. The chapter also presents a stable modeling platform for soft robotic systems that accommodates various shape functions designed for unique joint mobility imposed by the soft robot's design. Previous works in modeling literature often select these functions without proper consideration, such as using polynomial bases (Chapter \ref{chap:BeyondPCC}). This thesis proposes a geometric modal decomposition approach that extracts geometric strain modes from higher-fidelity FEM simulations to construct generic low-dimensional models that accurately encode the features and elasticity of soft bodies. This approach introduces a new strain parametrization called the "\textit{Data-driven Variable Strain}" (DVS) basis. Finally, the toolkit also presents four open-hardware soft robotic systems that can be easily fabricated using commercially available 3D printers, further enabling soft robotic technology for the community. Overall, \texttt{Sorotoki} is a versatile and flexible resource that can benefit many researchers and practitioners of soft robotics.

\section[Recommendations]{Recommendations}
\textbf{Three-dimensional inverse design:}  Chapter \ref{chap: design} presents the possibility for gradient-based design for soft robots through topology optimization. It has been demonstrated that relatively simple techniques can be utilized to identify locally "\textit{optimal}" structures based on desired morphology. However, due to computational limitations, only optimizations of planar mechanical structures have been considered. Therefore, further steps are necessary to convert the topology into a functional soft actuator structures. One recommendation for improving the optimization techniques discussed in this thesis is to expand their application to three-dimensional domains. This extension is strongly advised, as it facilitates the post-processing of the resulting topological structure, which can be more easily transferred to a 3D-printing platform. It is important to acknowledge that the computational complexity of finite element models experiences an increase of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ as $n$, the global degrees of freedom (DOF) of the mesh, grows. Given this significant computational burden, it is highly recommended that future research explores the use of GPU parallel computation or cluster computation. Alternatively, another potential avenue to consider is the adoption of the Material Point Method (MPM). The MPM presents certain advantages over FEM, such as its ability to manage larger mesh distortions and better conservation of mass and momentum. Furthermore, complex geometries can be handled more explicitly without necessitating remeshing. Despite the fact that MPM is computationally more demanding than FEM, there exist software packages providing parallel computation on multi-GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) architectures, which have already been implemented in the co-design optimization of soft robots for locomotion.

\textbf{Extension towards active and multi-materials optimization:} Another intriguing improvement upon Chapter \ref{chap: design} can be found in the area of multi-material topology optimization. One common issue with soft robots is that their supporting structures experience limited force transmissibility without significant deformations. Conducting research on multi-materials offers a promising solution, where the use of diverse materials, inspired for instance by natural muscular-skeletal systems, can result in a broader range of mechanical operation, eventually benefiting potential applications such as locomotion. Additionally, advancements in multi-material printing technology have made it easier to consolidate soft, rigid, and flexible conductive materials, or even mixtures thereof. This presents an opportunity to incorporate skeletal function along with proprioceptive sensing capabilities that can be directly integrated into the optimization loop.

\textbf{Free-floating and compositional soft bodies.} In Chapter \ref{chap:PCC} and \ref{chap:BeyondPCC}, we present modeling strategies for soft continuum robot manipulators, but the approach is also applicable to various other slender soft structures. We showed in Chapter \ref{chap:Sorotoki} that the approach is applicable to soft grippers, \eg, seminal works like \cite{Sinatra2019Aug,Suzumori1992}, and the bending fingers of a soft robot hand.

Yet, a significant limitation of our modeling methodology is that the soft beam's structural foundation yield zero velocity and acceleration inherently. Consequently, this limitation (partially) restricts applicability of the model to soft robotic systems designed for locomotion,closed-chain soft robots, or compositions of soft grippers on a fast moving mobile platform (\eg, drones or robot end-effectors). Other potential applications include academic study-cases that relate to control theory, such as swing-up control for soft pendulums. This modeling restriction arises from the model's projection into the desirable Lagrangian formulation by means of premultiplication of the geometric Jacobian. This effectively eliminates the boundary conditions at the foundation (\ie, the constraint wrenches) in the model and thereby ensuring that the states evolution always satisfy the imposed kinematic behavior.

In order to relax the model, it is necessary to incorporate the rigid-body
dynamics of the entire soft structure subjected to general motion, depicted by an inertial coordinate frame affixed at a certain location on the body. Although the selection of this inertial coordinate frame can be chosen arbitrary, opting for the base of the beam constitutes a reasonable choice inline with prior chapters. The equation of motions can be written using a Newton-Euler formulation, akin to the approach presented in Chapter \ref{chap:BeyondPCC}. Consequently, this necessitates a separate solver that calculates the inertia tensor, which accounts for changes of the CoM during deformation, and the lumped integration of all inertial wrench responsible for rigid-body motion. Theoretically, it is possible to streamline the spatial integration of Lagrangian matrices and rigid-body inertial dynamics into a one Matrix Differential Equation (MDE), with the objective of accelerating the computational procedure. Further research is required to investigate the numerical efficiency of these approaches, in order to facilitate online model-based control.

\textbf{Robustness of modal discretization for soft beam, a Chicken-and-Egg problem.} Although the prospect of expanding into the realm of locomotion is fascinating, it reveals a challenge that is not immediately apparent. Namely, there is no guarantee that a chosen modal strain discretization is representative of the spatial dynamics of the soft beams. Since in many cases robots operate in highly unstructured environment, there are infinitely many possible force wrenches of different amplitudes and frequency that can act as an disturbance to continuum system. Due to our inadequate understanding of the soft robotic system interacting with the unknown environment, it is difficult to select \textit{a-priori} an appropriate strain basis, if not impossible. This challenge has been previously discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:BeyondPCC}, where it was referred to as the \textit{"Chicken-and-Egg"} problem, primarily from the viewpoint of state feedback. A model-based feedback loop may trigger the excitation of strain modes that have not been accounted for the modeling procedure, hence it might paradoxically introduce its own errors. The implementation of model-based control leads to circular reasoning of cause-and-effect in regards to this phenomenon. Furthermore, ascertaining whether the closed-loop system can stabilize such unmodeled modes through rigorous mathematical analysis is challenging, since various numerical approximations of the PDE model are introduced.

A recommendation for future research involves conducting an in-depth mathematical analysis of the robustness towards the proposed modeling method and the resultant controllers. In Chapter \ref{chap:Sorotoki}, it was demonstrated that the DVS strain method is sufficiently flexible to accommodate (moderate) unmodelled disturbances that manifest as point contacts on multiple locations of a soft body. This discovery suggests that these models possess a certain degree of robustness against disturbances. Our hypothesis is that soft body may act as spatial low-pass filter that structurally penalizes high-order modes, thus a sufficiently large collection of ordered strain modes will alleviate the {Chicken-and-Egg} problem. This may provide an explanation for the successful performance of control structures that are based on the Piecewise-Constant Strain assumption thus far. One potential avenue for research involves the exploration of adaptive basis representations that can dynamically adjust their truncations based on observable model errors. This approach is partially inspired by the adaptive control methodology described in Chapter \ref{chap: design}. One potential recommendation could be to contemplate a large library of orthonormal spatial modes. To ensure a trade-off between precision and speed, an adaptive weight coefficient can be assigned to every mode. This coefficient can then be employed as a decision variable whether or not to include a given mode in the recursive numerical solver of the dynamic model, 

\textbf{Soft sensing applied to control.} An important area of control for robotics is sensing. While the main focus of this thesis centers around the modeling of soft actuation and mechanical structures, little emphasis is given on the topic of proprioceptive sensing. A possible recommendation can be to explore strain-sensitive materials that are directly embedded into the soft structures to recover the spatial modes of the soft robot. This also opens the area of optimal sensor placements which aims to enhance the accuracy and amount of information collected from the system while minimizing the number of sensors and extensive sensor wiring. Upon reviewing the available literature, it is apparent that this particular area of research is relatively new and has yet to be extensively explored. Moreover, similar to the concept of soft actuation, there is a plethora of sensor technologies available for the implementation of soft sensing. These options comprise magnetism, optical Fiber Bragg grating, color-changing meta-materials, and even the soft actuation mechanism itself.
