\section{State-of-the-art in soft robotics}
In this section, we will examine several unresolved research issues in the field of soft robotics. These topics primarily concern the design and control of soft robots. It should be emphasized that while these problems may seem distinct, they are often interconnected. For instance, the structural design of a soft robot influences its workspace and consequently affects the feasibility of \textit{a-prioiri} defined control objectives. This section aims to underscore such scientific interconnections and demonstrate the essential components required to address common paradigms.

\subsection{Tailoring design of fluidic soft actuation}
As the name soft robots arises from its use of soft materials, it follows that design and fabrication using soft materials play a huge role in their technological development. Contrary to rigid robots, many soft robots explore whole body movement rather than localized regions undergoing motion called \textit{"joints"}. In classic robotics, robots are composed of a countable number of rigid links and joints \cite{Spong2006,Murray1994,Corke2011}, either arranged in series or parallel. Together they span a workable range of motion called the \textit{workspace} \cite{Spong2006}. Focussing on rigid manipulators, whose base is often structurally fixated, their workspace can be obtained through a system of kinematics, often derived through a set of geometrical equalities. Rigid manipulators often have a bounded workspace (assuming actuation limits). In robotic locomotion, similar kinematic descriptions can be obtained for the legs and feet, with the exception of an additional free-floating base. In these cases, however, the workspace is of less interest, rather the different possibility of \textit{"gait cycles"} that arise from the link-joint configuration and actuator dynamics determine system's success for locomotion.

%However, contrary to manipulators, an additional global free-floating frame is introduced (\eg, a coordinate frame at the center of mass) that describe the global coordinates of the full robotic body. As such, for robotic locomotion, the workspaces are often unbounded and thus carry less importance. Nonetheless, their structural layout of joints and links play a crucial role in energy consumption. High efficiency in the cyclic exchange in potential and kinetic energy is hugely beneficial to the duration of locomotion. In any case, either manipulators and locomotion machines, the topological layout of the links and joints are of paramount importance.
Returning to soft robots,
the definitions such as {joints}, {workspace} and {gait cycles} also apply here. Yet, the high flexibility allows for many non-restricted joint displacements which make deriving closed-form mathematical descriptions challenging. The shape of workspace and locomotion patterns are majorly influenced by geometry of the soft actuator, its flexibility modes, and how forces are transferred with the continuum soft body. Controlling the motion within soft actuation -- so to speak reducing parasitic mobility and tailoring motion based on structural geometry -- is an active topic in soft robotics research for decades. \\

\textbf{Engineering principles in soft fluidic actuators}. In the past decade, researchers have developed various techniques of exploiting the high-elasticity of soft materials for \textit{controllable} actuation. One key development, similar working principles to the pneumatic muscle groups (see \cite{Mckibben,Morin1953} or Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}), are Soft Pneumatic Actuators (SPAs). A few examples are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:actuationtypes}. SPAs undergo similar mechanics akin to McKibben actuators \cite{Mckibben} or Morin actuators \cite{Morin1953}, yet they envelop a diverse collection of motion besides uniaxial. Examples include: contraction and elongation \cite{Yang2016}, axial growth \cite{Hawkes2017}, bending \cite{Mosadegh2014,Galloway2016,Marchese2016}, helical and twisting, and a hybridization of all the aforementioned motions \cite{Kim2019Aug}. An example of soft actuators capable of contraction is the Vacuum-Actuated Muscle-inspired Pneumatic (VAMP) structures by Yang et al. (2016, \cite{Yang2016}). Their work proposes a tailored geometrical structure embedded into a soft elastomer medium that is highly sensitive towards buckling. When subjected to a sufficiently large negative differential pressure, the internal structure undergoes a (reversible) mechanically instable leading to uniaxial contraction, we see in Figure \ref{fig:C0:actuationtypes}. Their work is inspired by a similar buckling behavior of patterned elastomer \cite{Bertoldi2008,Mullin2007,Shim2013Aug} subjected to axial loads. These muscle-inspired vacuum soft actuators are fast, produce a stable, repeatable motion; and more importantly, explore structural geometry to reduce parasitic motion. An example of soft bending actuators is the FLIP-FLOP system \cite{Cianchetti2013Nov}. Akin the ORM system \cite{BibEntryOrm2019Sep}, it has three pressure chambers embedded into a soft cylindrical-shaped elastomer. To prevent ballooning, inextensible rings are placed orthogonal to the deformable backbone. It design is also reminiscent of \cite{Suzumori1992,Suzumori1991}. Hawkes et al. (2017, \cite{Hawkes2017}) developed a soft manipulator inspired by the growing behavior of vines. Kim et al. (2019, \cite{Kim2019Aug}) used laminates that adhere to the volumetrically expanding soft body as to govern the motion trajectory through bending and twisting.

\textbf{Exploring optimization and evolutionary algorithms}. Besides design through engineering principles, optimization in soft robotics is slowly gaining momentum recent years. Wang et al. (2020, \cite{Wang2020Nov}) used a topology optimization to find the optimal design for a cable-driven soft gripper (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}a). Similarly, Tian et al. (2020, \cite{Tian2020May}) explored topology optimization for ferro-magnetic soft grippers. Besides soft grippers, evolutionary design algorithms are also employed for soft mobile like crawler and swimmers. Joachimczak et al. (2015, \cite{Joachimczak2014Jul,Joachimczak2015}) explored evolutionary search algorithm with the purpose of automatically designing complex morphologies and controllers of multi-cellular, soft-bodied robots (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}c). Hu et al. (2019, \cite{Hu2019taichi}) used a differential physics simulator called \texttt{DiffTachi} that efficiently computes gradient information for each simulation timestep. The gradient information can then be fed into neural network controllers to solve, for instance, the appropriate gait-cycles required in the locomotion of soft-bodied crawlers (Figure \ref{fig:C0:optztypes}d).

\subsection{Gaining performance through control}
\label{sec:C0:modelcontrol}
As the inherent properties in soft materials bring forth many benefits, \eg, adaptability, hyper-redundancy, and passivity w.r.t. the environment; it too hinders the progress in model-based controllers. Earlier, we have touched upon these subject with the rise of kinematic and dynamic models for hyper-redundant robotics in the late 80's -- early 90's. Chirikjian et al. (1992, \cite{Chirikjian1992}) provided a kinematic framework for hyper-redundant manipulators with application to motion planning (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}a). Here the elastic backbone is approximated using a modal formulation. Such modeling framework are one-to-one transferable to soft continuum manipulators. Mochiyama et al. (1998, \cite{Mochiyama1998,Mochiyama2003}) extended this work to a dynamics formulation -- even providing Lyapunov-based control strategies for shape regulations (Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}b). However, both modeling frameworks were computationally inefficient -- lacking transferability to real-time control. The root problem stems from the fact that soft continuum robots, belonging in their exact formulation to the field of continuum mechanics, lead to infinite-dimensional models often expressed as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Rigid multi-body systems, like robot manipulators or mobile robots on the other hand, have convenient Ordinary Differential Equation (ODEs) structures as they are rooted in Lagrangian or Newtonian mechanical principles. Rigid-body models were (and still are) fast computationally and their literature on controller design is vast and well-established \cite{Murray1994,Corke2011,Spong2006}. The computational issues in early continuum robots may be reflected by its literature gap between the 1990's to 2010's.

\textbf{A: Modern control-oriented models for soft robots.} In the past decade, significant steps have been made to address the issues of infinite dimensionality \cite{DellaSantina2021}. The key is to formulate a finite-dimensional approximation of the soft robot's dynamic such that they can be written as standard ODEs. Reduced-Order Models -- ROM for short -- have paved the path of model-based controller for soft robots whose reduced formulations are both tractable and precise. In the years shortly after its academic boom, many different assumptions and model approximations have come forth to address the issue of control.

\begin{rmk}
  The reduced-order formulations for soft robotics are primarily applicable to slender soft robots, leading to a focus on soft robot manipulators in control-oriented studies. This approach is well-motivated given that many soft robots have one dominant physical dimension compared to the other two \cite{DellaSantina2021}. As such, this thesis primarily focuses on the modeling and control of soft manipulators rather than a broader scope.
\end{rmk}

\par
Focussing on soft robot manipulators first, a popular choice of finite-dimensional reduction is the so-called \textit{Piecewise Constant Curvature} (PCC) soft beam model.
The PCC modeling approach is by far the most adopted in the soft robotics community \cite{Webster2010}. As the name implies, the soft robot is modelled as an elastically deformable beam with all strains but curvature neglected. Examples of this approximation include \cite{Falkenhahn2015,Marchese2016,Katzschmann2018,Katzschmann2019,Runge2017,Franco2020,Webster2010,DellaSantina2020a}. Highlighting a few, Katzschmann et al. (2018, \cite{Katzschmann2018}) proposed to connect the PCC formulation to an augmented rigid robot dynamical model with parallel elastic actuation (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}c). A similar approach was proposed earlier by Falkenhanh et al. (2015, \cite{Falkenhahn2015}) and applied to Festo's bionic arm \cite{Grzesiak2011}. Although such lumped models may seem like a major over-simplification, the proposed model allows sufficient speed and accuracy such that model-based feedback is applicable. This formulation was also employed later in an adaptive sliding mode control scheme \cite{Kazemipour2022May} for the SoPra soft arm \cite{Toshimitsu2021Sep}. Following, Renda et al. (2018, \cite{Renda2018}) extended the PCC model to \textit{Piecewise Constant Strain} (PCS) formulation. This formulation allowed for all strain if and only if considered spatially piece-wise constant (Figure \ref{fig:C0:modeltypes}d). Rooted in $\SE{3}$ geometry of the Cosserat approach \cite{Simo1986}, it provided a closer relation with the rigid body geometry of the traditional robotics. The formulation also extends to soft manipulators with fluidic actuation \cite{Renda2017Aug, Till2019} The PCS model was later employed to feedforward controllers by Thuruthel et al. (2018, \cite{Thuruthel2018Nov}) using model-based policy learning algorithms. To improve efficiency, a recurrent neural network was trained using an offline PCS model. Grazioso et al. (2019, \cite{Grazioso2019}) explored a similar path of geometric Cosserat beams using helical strain functions. Nevertheless, Constant Strain (CS) models have severe limitations. They often do not originate from continuum mechanics and thus are only applicable in restrictive settings. Although computationally performance might surpass continuous models, due to intrinsic kinematic restrictions, they are unable to capture important continuum phenomena, like buckling, environmental interaction, or wave propagation.

In response to its limitation, many researchers continued their search for efficient and more generalizable alternative. Della Santina et al. (2020, \cite{DellaSantina2020}) proposed a polynomial description to described the continuum dynamics, a description analogous to \cite{Chirikjian1992}. In their work, they expressed the curvature function of the soft robot in terms of a standard polynomial bases. Not only can an exact infinite dimensional formulation of the problem be obtained (in theory), truncation at any level is changed easily. The technique is also widely used for flexible-link robot manipulators to capture small vibrations, see DeLuca et al. (2016, \cite{DeLuca2016Jul}). Della Santina et al. also showed that PCC-rooted assumptions as control output produce a minimum phase system \cite{DellaSantina2020} -- a fundamental stepping-stone for nonlinear control. Following, Boyer et al. (2021, \cite{Boyer2021}) extended upon their prior Cosserat models \cite{Renda2018,Renda2020}, and presented a tractable and generalizable beam model for slender soft manipulators. A similar approach to \cite{DellaSantina2020} was followed but all strains are discretized using a finite set of strain basis functions. Renda et al. (2020, \cite{Renda2020}) improved computation by introducing a two-stage Gauss quadrature \cite{Zanna1999} to derive the Magnus expansion \cite{Hairer2002}. Other examples of the Cosserat beam descriptions, but more focussed on the continuum mechanics rather than control, is the work Gazzola et al. (2018, \cite{Gazzola2018}). Their work allowed for efficient Cosserat beam models suitable for self-collision, thus providing various simulation for twirling and coiling of beams under increasing torsional loads.

Another popular alternative, better suited for general soft robotic systems like soft mobile robots, are reduced-order finite element models \cite{Duriez2013,Coevoet2017,Coevoet2017Feb,Goury2018,Thieffry2017,Thieffry2020,Tonkens2021May,Katzschmann2019Apr,Wu2021Feb,Zhang2017} or neural-network trained using offline FEM simulations \cite{Fang2020Dec}. Starting from high-order FEM data (\eg, state dimensions of the order $10$k) that capture the whole workspace spanned by the network of soft actuators, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques are employed to drastically to reduce the state dimension of the soft robot model. These techniques can even retain external loads (\eg, contact and friction) with precision as long as they are included in the offline data set \cite{Goury2018}. By far, this FEM-driven method has shown the most success in the experimental control regime.

\textbf{Soft robot simulation and programming environments}.
%
The rapid development of soft robotic models in recent years have also increased the demand for (open-access) software packages. Especially since many of the aforementioned ROM models require an advanced level of mathematical understanding. In an attempt to help the soft robotics community, many researchers have provided open-source, documented simulators interwoven in their soft robotics research. A popular FEM-based software on soft robotic modeling and control is \texttt{SOFA} by Duriez et al. (2013, \cite{Duriez2013,Coevoet2017}). \texttt{DiffTachi} by Hu et al. \cite{Hu2019taichi, Hu2019Oct} explores differential simulations to produce soft machine capable of locomotion. Bern et al. (2022, \cite{Bern2022,Bern2019}) developed \texttt{SoftIK}, a software for soft deformable plushy robots. Among beam or rod-based models there exist many options. Examples included \texttt{Elastica} (or \texttt{pyElastica} \cite{Tekinalp2022}) by Gazzola et al. \cite{Gazzola2018,Zhang2019}, \texttt{TMTDyn} by Sadati et al. \cite{Sadati2020}, \texttt{SimSOFT} by Grazioso et al. \cite{Grazioso2019}, and \texttt{SoRoSim} by Mathew et al. \cite{Mathew2021Jul} based on the work of Renda et al. \cite{Renda2020} and Boyer et al. \cite{Boyer2021}. The \texttt{Sorotoki} toolkit by Caasenbrood et al. \cite{SorotokiCode}  -- open-source software package presented as a part of this thesis  -- explores a combination of FEM models and soft beam models. The toolkit written in Matlab aims to bridge the gaps between design, modeling, and control of (hyper-elastic) soft robots.

\textbf{Closing the loop in soft robotics}. Following the many developments in computational efficiency of reduced-order models (and accordingly the advances in soft sensing), academic research in model-based or model-free control for soft robots is significantly growing since early 2019. Note that feedforward controllers for soft manipulators have been proposed years prior, \eg, \cite{Falkenhahn2015May,Falkenhahn2015,Thuruthel2017Oct,Satheeshbabu2019May}.

By far, experimental validation of PCC model has been used more intensively than other models. In Della Santina et al. (2019. \cite{DellaSantina2020a}, the augmented rigid-body PCC model is used to design a closed-loop controller for a continuous soft manipulator, presenting two architectures designed for dynamic trajectory tracking and surface following. Prior work is provided here \cite{Katzschmann2019}. A similar approach was followed by Milana et al. (2021, \cite{Milana2021Apr}) and applied to an artificial soft cilia. They showed that soft bending actuators could mimic the asymmetric motion of the cilia through model-based control. Cao et al. (2021, \cite{Cao2021Apr}) explored a reduced analytical model \cite{Wang2019Apr}, somewhat equivalent to a linear pendulum model (apart from quadratic terms in the potential force); to develop robust tracking controllers without velocity observers. Their controller was tested experimentally on a soft PneuNet actuator. Wang et al. (2022, \cite{Wang2022Mar}) developed a computed torque controller (see \cite{Spong2006}) using the augmented rigid-body PCC model and applied it to a soft Honeycomb Pneumatic Network Arm \cite{Jiang2016Dec}. Franco et al. (2020, \cite{Franco2020,Franco2020Jan}) used a port-Hamiltonian modeling framework akin to rigid-body PCC model (\ie, three-link pendulum) and applied such principles to energy-shaping controllers. The performance of their controller was assessed via simulations and via experiments on two soft continuum prototypes. On a side note, Franco et al. (2022, \cite{Franco2022May}) also developed an energy-shaping control law together with nonlinear observers for the control of soft growing robots \cite{Hawkes2017} with pneumatic actuation subject to the (ideal) gas laws.

As mentioned previously, the PCC model has significant limitation that impose questions on the useability, dexterity, and robustness of their control derivation. Although majorly focussed on simulation, higher-order dynamics have been used for the development of feedback controller in soft manipulators. Della Santina et al. (\cite{DellaSantina2021}) developed swing-up controllers for a soft pendulum modelled by the affine curvature models (\ie, a polynomial curvature model \cite{DellaSantina2020} of order $k = 2$). Their approach mirrors the path of classic control problem of inverted pendulums in the 90s and early 2000s \cite{Spong1996,Spong1996a,Ortega1998,Shiriaev1999Dec}. Later, Weerakoon et al. (2021, \cite{Weerakoon2021Dec}) extended upon their work by introducing a revolute base. A common control problem here is under-actuation \cite{Tedrake2022,Spong2006,Murray1994} -- implying that not all control actions can be realized to steer the configuration space to a desired position. In the work of Borja et al. (2022, \cite{Borja2022Apr}) developed a general control framework that can stabilize soft manipulators based on potential energy shaping based on the affine curvature model. Their work showed that some linear matrix inequalities can be derived based on the gradient of the potential energy related to the passive and active states, such that local stability can be proven. In laymen terms, elasticity must dominate the forces resulting from the gravity in the underactuated states for (potential) energy-shaping controllers (and mostly-like others) to work.
