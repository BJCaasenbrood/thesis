\section{Early soft robotic technology}
In this chapter, we will present a brief historical overview of soft robotics, showing that the current trends of biomimicry and elasticity in robotics have roots in a period long before the soft robotic boom in the early 2010s. To guide the reader, in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}, we provide a graphical historical overview of soft robotic systems from 1950 to 2023. We will discuss the inception of soft actuation, early soft robotic designs, and modeling and control strategies for these continuum robotics.

To relate the historical progress of soft robots with respect to rigid robots, we begin with early rigid robots. In 1954, George Devol filed a patent describing an autonomous robotic machine that could be preprogrammed to execute step-by-step motions \cite{Mickle2008}. The machine was designed to reduce the workload on the manufacturing work floor, with a major focus on mimicking repetitive (exhausting) human labor. In 1958, those prototypes led to a robotic system under the name \textit{"Unimate"}. An illustration of this early rigid robot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}. The Unimate was used for manipulating metal die-casts and welding them to the main body of automobiles, revolutionizing the car industry shortly after. Victor Scheinman created the Stanford Arm in 1969 \cite{BibEntryStanford2022Sep,BibEntryOrm2019Sep}, which is recognized as the first electronic computer-controlled robotic arm because the Unimate's instructions (\ie, predefined set-points in joint space) were prerecorded on a magnetic drum. Later, in 1972, he developed the well-known PUMA robot (video footage available at \cite{BibEntryPuma2022Sep}), which was the successor to the Unimate. It is important to keep Scheinman in mind as he ultimately ties to early soft robots.\vspace{0.085em}

Nearly four years after the development of Unimate, Joseph McKibben created a linearly contractile pneumatic muscle-inspired actuator called the "\emph{McKibben actuator}". The McKibben muscle is a type of Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) that is still the most frequently used and published artificial muscle in literature. According to \cite{Mckibben}, he developed the McKibben actuators to help his daughter's polio-paralyzed hand move, grasp, and even write. The McKibben actuator is inspired by the human muscle and consists of an inflatable inner bladder enveloped with a double-helical weave. When pressurized, the fluidic actuator converts radial expansion into uniaxial contraction \cite{Daerden1999, Daerden2000, Schulte1961}. The interlacing weave effectively inhibits extensive ballooning, which is the undesirable phenomenon of rapidly accelerating volumetric expansion. Its material composition is often silicone rubber with a nylon-fiber exterior. A schematic representation of a general pneumatic muscle and the effect of ballooning are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben}. As mentioned earlier, ballooning is an often undesired nonlinear effect where the hyperelastic pressure vessel exhibits strain-softening after a critical point is reached, resulting in further increase of pressure leading to exponential growth in volume, ultimately leading to actuator tearing. At stages of ballooning, mechanical performance significantly drops and even produces adverse effects, like actuation reversal. McKibben solved this problem through a combination of soft and inextensible fiber weaves. These inextensible fibers were placed at the exterior wall of the soft muscle, thereby limiting the radial expansion before ballooning could occur. According to Daerden \cite{Daerden1999}, there exist many variations of pneumatic muscles besides braided muscles, such as the netted muscles (\eg, Yarlott \cite{Yarlott1972}, ROMAC \cite{Immega1986}, and Kukolj \cite{Kukolj1988}) and embedded muscles (\eg, Morin \cite{Morin1953}, Paynter Hyperboloid \cite{Paynter1988}). Illustrations of their patent schematics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C0:several_PAM}.

Pneumatic muscles are perhaps one of the first fundamental technologies that enabled soft robotics, and to this day, they remain a framework for many soft robotic systems. Nevertheless, besides the many examples of fluidics \cite{Marchese2014, Marchese2016, Katzschmann2018, Suzumori1991, Mosadegh2014}, there exist many other technologies employed in soft robotic motion, such as thermal \cite{Wu2021Dec} or chemical expansion/contraction \cite{Tolley2014, Bartlett2015, Wehner2016}, crystal realignment \cite{Pilz2020, Lopez2018, Vantomme2021, Polygerinos2013}, dielectric elastomers \cite{Keplinger2011}, magnetism \cite{Roh2019Apr, KimYoonho2018, McDonald2020, Boyvat2017Jul}, and naturally the use of tendons paired with electromechanical actuation \cite{Renda2018, Bern2019, Kim2020Jun, Coevoet2017Feb, Wang2016Sep}. Some of these technologies predate the invention of the McKibben actuator. For example, Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEA) developed by R\"{o}ntgen in 1880 \cite{Rontgen1880} are still a popular soft actuation principle applied in soft robotics today. Therefore, given the abundance of soft robotic actuation, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact date of origin of soft actuation technology. Note, however, that these systems are not categorized as soft robots but rather as soft actuators. Here, we emphasize the difference between soft actuators and soft robots in view of the modeling and control terminology relevant to the thesis:
%
\terminology{\textbf{Soft actuators} are controllable flexible actuation units of the constitute soft robot that through external stimuli are responsible for natural motion within the system or for a change in its compliance. %By definition, a soft actuator is a single-input-multi-output (SIMO) system.
}{}
%
\begin{rmk} The above terminology aims to resolve a common ambiguity in soft robotics, where the terms "soft actuator" and "soft robot" are often used interchangeably. Following the terminology applicable to this thesis, a soft robot must consist of one or more soft actuators connected to a single passive deformable body. This soft body serves as a mechanical conduit between the actuators, sensors, and the environment, and the combination of all is referred to as the "\emph{robot}". 
\end{rmk}
\vspace{-3mm}
\section{Recognition of soft robotics' potential} Returning to 1965, nearly a decade after the invention of the McKibben actuator and the Unimate robot, Scheinman and Leifer proposed a novel pneumatic robotic arm named the \emph{Orm} -- Norwegian for snake (recall that they also developed the popular PUMA robot \cite{BibEntryPuma2022Sep}). The name was also an abbreviation for Object-Relational Mapping tool \cite{Corke2020}. To the author's knowledge, this is believed to be the first instance of soft robotics. Surprisingly, the system predates any rigid snake-like robot, like the Scripps tensor arm by Anderson \cite{Anderson1968}. Inspired by the anatomy of snakes, the system featured 28 rubber pneumatic artificial muscles (\ie, bellows) distributed along a flexible backbone (\ie, skeletal support). The network of artificial muscles was sandwiched between steel plates to prevent misalignment. It is worth mentioning that the technology is analogous to the pneumatic McKibben muscle, where fiber weaves are used to prevent ballooning. Yet, contrary to a single McKibben actuator, the soft robotic system could undergo three-dimensional movement by inflation or deflation of an embedded pneumatic network. This led to a rich set of movements previously unseen in rigid robotics. As an illustrative example, we provide the mechanics of the Orm soft robot in Figure \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}. The soft robot could achieve bending in any preferred direction by differential pressurization of each channel and elongation through synchronized actuation. Most notably, comparing the volume-strain response of the Orm with respect to the McKibben actuator, \ie, comparing Figure \ref{fig:C0:mckibben} against \ref{fig:C0:ormrobot}, it is noticeably more linear in nature. Although not documented at the time, the comparison highlights the importance of structural geometry in pneumatic muscles.

According to an interview with Scheinman conducted by Asaro et al. \cite{ETHW2020Dec} in 2010, the positional accuracy of the Orm system was poor, which may have generally led to a loss of academic interest in similar fluidic robotics in the 1960s. However, the concept of continuum robotic arms continued to be explored for many years. Three years later, in 1968, Anderson and Horn proposed and patented an improved hyper-redundant robot manipulator (see Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline}). Anderson's design improved upon the Orm, which was deemed slow and had limited positional accuracy. He proposed an array of nylon tendons that were connected to rigid discs distributed along the redundant backbone of the robot. The configurable backbone was comprised of universal spherical joints that allowed for pivoting motion with respect to other discs, totaling 16 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs). The entire arm was actuated hydraulically, yet the (soft) actuators were placed outside the robot's body rather than at each joint, like the Orm. To improve positional accuracy further, Anderson placed sensor tendons parallel to the actuator tendons, which allowed for operator-based positional feedback. Although Anderson's robot does not classify as a soft robot since it relies mostly on rigid materials, its flexibility arose from thin nylon tendons that were used for both actuation and sensing. Anderson showed that a network of distributed sensors is necessary to control the complex morphological shapes in hyper-redundant robotic systems while also mitigating the sensor's effect on mobility. Let us introduce the notion of soft sensors -- the dual of soft actuators:
%
\vspace{1mm}
\terminology{\textbf{(Proprioceptive) soft sensors} are flexible measurements units embedded into the soft robotic body that through external stimuli measure the (local) changes of the system. Softness here implies that the sensor minimally alters the global mechanical behavior of the robot.
}{}
%
\begin{rmk}
\vspace{-5mm}
Our definition of soft sensors emphasizes their ability to "minimally alter the global mechanical behavior." It is worth mentioning that these sensors may be comprised of stiff or even rigid components. However, they must be incorporated into or onto the soft body in a way that minimally affects the operational workspace of the soft actuator network in static or dynamic operating conditions. With a slight abuse of definition, exteroceptive sensors such as a camera vision system (\eg, OptiTrack) are inherently soft as they do not affect the compliance.
\end{rmk}

\textbf{Soft robotics in the early 80's}. Since the seminal works of McKibben and subsequent research by Scheinman and Anderson, the field of soft Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) in robotics has experienced rapid growth since the early 1980s. Figure \ref{fig:C0:earlyPAMrobots} shows a few examples of early soft robotic systems. Teleshev \cite{Teleshev1981} developed a soft gripper reminiscent of modern PneuNet actuators \cite{Galloway2016, Mosadegh2014, Choi2011} - a rectangular bellow-shaped soft actuator. Unlike uniaxial PAMs, which are radially symmetric, these soft grippers explored an asymmetrical design of bellows. The geometry led to a stiffness differential around the circumference, resulting in their iconic bending motion. Still popular today, these pneumatic bending actuators find their origin back in early 1974, as seen in Andorf et al. \cite{Andorf1974}. A decade later, Takagi et al. \cite{Takagi1983} developed a soft multi-joint robot manipulator that resembles the human arm with its movements and antagonistic muscle pairs. Although their PAMs, called \textit{Rubbertuator}, had a function and design identical to McKibben's PAMs, their system showed the merits of combining soft and rigid materials. They observed not only a high degree of positional control of the robot arm, but force control was also easily regulated by pressure control, which naturally had safety benefits. The soft robot arm could perform delicate low-force tasks while simultaneously blocking motion when encountering a human.These soft properties were lacking in rigid robotic manipulators at the time but were reminiscent of their biological counterpart -- the human arm. Note that, at that time, force and impedance control for rigid robotics had been topics of academic research for years \cite{Anderson1988, Khatib1987, Hogan1984, Hogan1984Jan}, dating back to the early 1970s (\eg, see also \cite{Markiewicz1973}). However, achieving similar properties without control was rarely explored at the time.

\par Shortly after, Wilson \cite{Wilson2007} developed a soft robot manipulator based on the elephant's trunk at Duke University in Durham. His design effectively combined the works of Teleshev \cite{Teleshev1981} and Takagi et al. \cite{Takagi1983} into a robot with similar dexterity but minimal use of rigid components. According to Weisburd \cite{Weisburd1988}, his idea stemmed from the work of Kier and Smith \cite{Kier1985} who studied the biomechanics of muscular hydrostats in animals such as cephalopods (\eg, squids). The work of Kier et al. \cite{Kier1985} studied how complex motions are produced in muscular organs, like elongation, shortening, bending, and torsion. Inspired by the muscular hydrostat in the elephant's trunk, Wilson developed a soft arm made from polyurethane tubes that worked as half-bellows, which enabled expansion and bending under positive pressurization \cite{Weisburd1988}. To accommodate three-dimensional movement, each soft pneumatic link was placed at a $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$ twist offset relative to the previous link. To illustrate the motion of the soft arm, a few snapshots are provided in Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_srm_robot}. Wilson hypothesized that these highly compliant robots would be more mechanically robust and sufficiently dexterous for tight workspaces, contrary to their rigid counterparts. Although the dexterity was novel, the positional accuracy was poor. The main problem stemmed from the soft arm being controlled in open-loop (\ie., remote teleoperation) without proprioceptive sensing or any positional feedback control, an issue akin to the Orm \cite{Corke2020}.

A few years later, Buckley et al. \cite{Buckley2012} developed the Shadow Walker -- a bipedal rigid robot comprised of antagonistic McKibben muscle pairs. Although not fully soft, their system did explore proprioceptive sensing. The hip, knee, and ankle joints were equipped with resistance-variable potentiometers for position feedback, whereas all the muscles had tension sensors for force feedback. Later on, these resistive sensors were replaced by analog optical sensors to improve robustness \cite{Buckley2012}. Although the system was top-heavy due to the pneumatic control hardware (\eg, valves and piping), rudimentary locomotion was possible. Interestingly, a similar artificial muscle system is still being explored in humanoid robotics today, such as the Atlas from Boston Dynamics. The success of pairing soft muscles with proprioceptive sensing eventually led to the development of the McKibben Shadow Hand \cite{Buckley2012, Gong2022Feb}, which is comprised of 40 uniquely addressable soft muscles.

Each finger possesses three pneumatic chambers that allow for directional bending -- analogous to the Orm. Through proper coordination of a set of soft fingers, various gripping complexities can be achieved, such as clockwise turning of a mechanical hex bolt (as shown above). Suzumori et al. showed that these intricate finger motions can be easily achieved by careful modeling of the fingertip dynamics and exploring the adaptability of soft materials.

Following Suzumori and Saiko \cite{Suzumori1991, Suzumori1992}, they developed a micro flexible soft actuator driven by an electro-hydraulic system (intrinsic length $L \approx 12$ \si{\milli\meter}). Each end-effector enables three DoFs, including pitch, yaw, and stretch, making it ideal for fingers, arms, and legs. Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_grip_robot} shows the level of dexterity in their system. By placing the four PAMs parallel on a gripper mount and assigning a predefined trajectory, they demonstrated that their soft robotic system has sufficient dexterity to mount a hexagon bolt at incredible speed and precision. To achieve such dexterity and precision, Suzumori et al. \cite{Suzumori1991} employed various modeling and control strategies to account for the dynamical characteristics under high-frequency, fluid compressibility, and the closing mechanics of pressure valves. Furthermore, the kinematics of each finger were derived using a generalized homogeneous transformation, akin to traditional robotics. Knowing both the compliance characteristics (pressure-deformation relations) and the forward kinematics, a Jacobian-based position controller was employed to regulate the Cartesian coordinates of the fingertips (successfully, one might add, as shown by Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_grip_robot}).

\par \textbf{Early controllers for hyper-redundant (soft) robots}. Following the increasing interest in highly-flexible robots in the late 80s, academic research into controlling these \textit{hyper-redundant} robots boomed shortly after. At the time, the term hyper-redundancy -- being an extension of redundancy in robotics \cite{MerriamWebster1983} -- was defined as the relative degree of kinematic and/or actuator redundancy that is large or even infinite \cite{Chirikjian1992, Chirikjian1994}. The term was first introduced by Chirikjian and Burdick \cite{Chirikjian1989}. Others referred to these robots as \textit{highly redundant} \cite{Wilson1988Dec, Naccarato1989Dec} or \textit{High Degree-of-Freedom} (HDOF) manipulators \cite{Salerno1989Jan, Mochiyama1999}. Around that time, Chirikjian and Burdick provided a plethora of mathematical foundations \cite{Chirikjian1994, Chirikjian1994Jun, Chirikjian1991, Chirikjian1992, Chirikjian1992Dec} focused on the kinematics and motion planning of hyper-redundant manipulators. Their work presented a modal discretization approach to describe the shape of the deformable backbone \cite{Chirikjian1994Jun}, and from this, geometric approaches were introduced to solve obstacle-avoiding trajectories using generalized \textit{follow-the-leader} strategies \cite{Chirikjian1992Dec}. Especially the latter showed the limitations of rigid low-redundancy manipulators. Although Chirikjian laid the foundation for the control of hyper-redundant robots, the basic principles of motion planning in pneumatic hyper-redundant robots were already presented by Wilson et al. \cite{Wilson1988Dec, Wilson1989Jun}, yet they were not called hyper-redundant robots or soft robots at that time. Recall also that the work of Wilson et al. has been shown earlier in Figure \ref{fig:C0:timeline} and Figure \ref{fig:C0:fist_srm_robot}. In Brock et al. \cite{Brock1991}, a similar analysis was used for optimal shape design of thin elastic rods to realize desired robotic compliance. Besides, there exists an abundance of literature prior to \cite{Chirikjian1992} on Variable Geometry Truss Manipulators (VGTMs) -- a variant of hyper-redundant tensegrity robotics -- that dealt with motion planning for such systems \cite{Naccarato1989Dec, Naccarato1991Apr, Salerno1989Jan}. Later, Mochiyama et al. \cite{Mochiyama1998, Mochiyama1999}, built upon Chirikjian's work by extending it to a dynamic formulation for elastic rods such that classic controller design is possible. They proposed shape-regulation controllers for HDOF manipulator by projecting them onto time-invariant curves, thereby showing that estimating the desired curve parameters is crucial to solving the problem by Lyapunov design \cite{Mochiyama1998}. Although there existed a variety of modeling and control strategies, computational power in relation to modeling complexity was the limiting factor for the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer at the time.
