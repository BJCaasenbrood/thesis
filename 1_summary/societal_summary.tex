%Writing a public summary is part of the completion of PhD-projects at TU/e since 2017. It serves to open up the results of PhD-research to larger audiences, among which journalists and the general audience.

%The doctoral candidate writes the public summary of
%maximum 600 words
%before submitting form 2. Guidelines, examples and a template for writing a public summary can be found at www.tue.nl/promoties. The candidate sends the summary to the science information officers of CEC, via the upload form on the Promotions website. They will contact the doctoral candidate in order to jointly do editing, if necessary, and make sure the text is comprehensible and accessible.

%The final version of the summary will be published on the TU/e website, in the overview of PhD defenses. CEC draws the attention of journalists to this overview, and targets journalists directly with summaries. The summary will also be available online via the library.

%It is helpful if the candidate also supplies a picture, via the upload form. This may be a picture of the candidate, or a crucial part or result of the research. The picture will be included in the online overview of PhDâ€™s, in landscape orientation and in quite small size. Therefore the content of the picture should be recognizable even in small size.
%Writing a public summary is not a prerequisite for graduation, but the university appreciates it very much if you do write one. In the department of Mechanical Engineering however the public summary (a.k.a. societal summary) is obligatory.
