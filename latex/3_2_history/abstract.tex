This chapter presents a detailed chronology of the evolution of soft robotics, from its inception in the early 1950s to current research trends. The aim is to provide an insightful introduction to the extensive field of soft robotics. The chapter commences by tracing the origins of soft robotics in pneumatic muscles, including the pioneering work of Joseph McKibben and Victor Scheinman. Subsequently, we explore the emergence of novel concepts and technologies that facilitated the development of increasingly sophisticated soft robots through the utilization of exotic material properties. Throughout the chapter, significant milestones in the development of soft robotics are highlighted, such as the creation of the first soft gripper, the integration of robotics with soft actuations, and the introduction of design and modeling principles for these systems, as well as early control approaches. Additionally, the chapter highlights some of the key challenges that lie ahead for the field, which serve as a basis for standardization of terminology. In short, this chapter offers an insightful and comprehensive perspective on the history of soft robotics and will further aid the reader in solidifying the thesis' objectives introduced in the previous chapter.
