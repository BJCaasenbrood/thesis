abstract = {In this article, we propose a new dynamic model of Cosserat beams in view of its application to continuum and soft robotics manipulation and locomotion. In contrast to usual approaches, it is based on the nonlinear parameterization of the beam shape by its strain fields and their reduction on a functional basis of strain modes. While remaining geometrically exact, the approach provides us with a minimal set of ordinary differential equations in the usual Lagrange matrix form that can be exploited for analysis and control design. Inspired from rigid robotics, the calculation of the matrices of this Lagrangian model is performed with a new reduced inverse Newton-Euler algorithm. To assess the approach, this Lagrangian model is compared against a well-validated finite element method through several benches of nonlinear structural statics and dynamics.},

abstract = {Most devices for single-site or natural orifice transluminal surgery are very application specific and, hence, capable of effectively carrying out specific surgical tasks only. However, most of these instruments are rigid, lack a sufficient number of degrees of freedom (DOFs), and/or are incapable of modifying their mechanical properties based on the tasks to be performed. The current philosophy in commercial instrument design is mainly focused on creating minimally invasive surgical systems using rigid tools equipped with dexterous tips. Only few research efforts are aimed at developing flexible surgical systems, with many DOFs or even continuum kinematics. The authors propose a radical change in surgical instrument design: away from rigid tools toward a new concept of soft and stiffness-controllable instruments. Inspired by biology, we envision creating such soft and stiffness-controllable medical devices using the octopus as a model. The octopus presents all the capabilities requested and can be viewed as a precious source of inspiration. Several soft technologies are suitable for meeting the aforementioned capabilities, and in this article a brief review of the most promising ones is presented. Then we illustrate how specific technologies can be applied in the design of a novel manipulator for flexible surgery by discussing its potential and by presenting feasibility tests of a prototype responding to this new design philosophy. Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of applying these technologies in the field of minimally invasive surgery and at the same time to stimulate the creativeness of others who could take the proposed concepts further to achieve novel solutions and generate specific application scenarios for the devised technologies.},

abstract = {The technological differences between traditional robotics and soft robotics have an impact on all of the modeling tools generally in use, including direct kinematics and inverse models, Jacobians, and dynamics. Due to the lack of precise modeling and control methods for soft robots, the promising concepts of using such design for complex applications (medicine, assistance, domestic robotics...) cannot be practically implemented. This paper presents a first unified software framework dedicated to modeling, simulation and control of soft robots. The framework relies on continuum mechanics for modeling the robotic parts and boundary conditions like actuators or contacts using a unified representation based on Lagrange multipliers. It enables the digital robot to be simulated in its environment using a direct model. The model can also be inverted online using an optimization-based method which allows to control the physical robots in the task space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we present various soft robots scenarios including ones where the robot is interacting with its environment. The software has been built on top of SOFA, an open-source framework for deformable online simulation and is available at https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/},

Soft lithography was used to fabricate a pneumatically actuated robot capable of sophisticated locomotion (e.g., fluid movement of limbs and multiple gaits). This robot is quadrupedal; it uses no sensors, only five actuators, and a simple pneumatic valving system that operates at low pressures (< 10 psi). A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle. This demonstration illustrates an advantage of soft robotics: They are systems in which simple types of actuation produce complex motion.},

abstract = {The complex nature of soft robot dynamics calls for the development of models specifically tailored on the control application. In this letter, we take a first step in this direction by proposing a dynamic model for slender soft robots, taking into account the fully infinite-dimensional dynamical structure of the system. We also contextually introduce a strategy to approximate this model at any level of detail through a finite dimensional system. First, we analyze the main mathematical properties of this model in the case of lightweight and non lightweight soft robots. Then, we prove that using the constant term of curvature as control output produces a minimum phase system, in this way providing the theoretical support that existing curvature control techniques lack, and at the same time opening up to the use of advanced nonlinear control techniques. Finally, we propose a new controller, i.e., the PD-poly, which exploits information on high order deformations, to achieve zero steady state regulation error in presence of gravity and generic nonconstant curvature conditions.},

However, the exploitation of these abilities is constrained by the lack of appropriate control strategies. This work tackles for the first time the development of closed-loop dynamic controllers for a continuous soft robot. We present two architectures designed for dynamic trajectory tracking and surface following, respectively. Both controllers are designed to preserve the natural softness of the robot and adapt to interactions with an unstructured environment. The validity of the controllers is proven analytically within the hypotheses of the model. The controllers are evaluated through an extensive series of simulations, and through experiments on a physical soft robot capable of planar motions.},

This design solution aims to bring robots closer to invertebrate animals and soft appendices of vertebrate animals (e.g., an elephant's trunk, a monkey's tail). This work aims to introduce the control theorist perspective to this novel development in robotics. We aim to remove the barriers to entry into this field by presenting existing results and future challenges using a unified language and within a coherent framework. Indeed, the main difficulty in entering this field is the wide variability of terminology and scientific backgrounds, making it quite hard to acquire a comprehensive view on the topic. Another limiting factor is that it is not obvious where to draw a clear line between the limitations imposed by the technology not being mature yet and the challenges intrinsic to this class of robots. In this work, we argue that the intrinsic effects are the continuum or multi-body dynamics, the presence of a non-negligible elastic potential field, and the variability in sensing and actuation strategies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for the control of soft robots with elastic behavior, piloted by several actuators. The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Soft continuum manipulators offer levels of compliance and inherent safety that can render them a superior alternative to conventional rigid robots for a variety of tasks, such as medical interventions or human–robot interaction. However, the ability of soft continuum manipulators to compensate for external disturbances needs to be further enhanced to meet the stringent requirements of many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the control problem for soft continuum manipulators that consist of one inextensible segment of constant section, which bends under the effect of the internal pressure and is subject to unknown disturbances acting in the plane of bending. A rigid-link model of the manipulator with a single input pressure is employed for control purposes and an energy-shaping approach is proposed to derive the control law. A method for the adaptive estimation of disturbances is detailed and a disturbance compensation strategy is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated with simulations and with experiments on an inextensible soft continuum manipulator that employs pneumatic actuation.},

Also, DQ kinematics does not suffer from singularity related limitations of Euler angle based inverse orientation kinematics. Recursive schemes for deriving DQ's and DQ Jacobians are also presented and can be extended arbitrarily. Both modal HTM and modal DQ kinematics are then applied to solve illustrative spatial inverse position and orientation tracking problems.

This paper should invert this idea. The proposed methodology offers the possibility to dramatically reduce the size and the online computation time of a finite element model (FEM) of a soft robot. After a set of expensive offline simulations based on the whole model, we apply snapshot-proper orthogonal decomposition to sharply reduce the number of state variables of the soft-robot model. To keep the computational efficiency, hyperreduction is used to perform the integration on a reduced domain. The method allows to tune the error during the two main steps of complexity reduction. The method handles external loads (contact, friction, gravity, etc.) with precision as long as they are tested during the offline simulations. The method is validated on two very different examples of FEMs of soft robots and on one real soft robot. It enables acceleration factors of more than 100, while saving accuracy, in particular compared to coarsely meshed FEMs and provides a generic way to control soft robots.},

Starting from the Cosserat rod theory formulated on a Lie group, we derive a discrete model using a helicoidal shape function for the spatial discretization and a geometric scheme for the time integration of the robot shape configuration. The main motivation behind this work is the derivation of accurate and computational efficient models for soft robots. The model takes into account bending, torsion, shear, and axial deformations due to general external loading conditions. It is validated through analytic and experimental benchmark. The results demonstrate that the model matches experimental positions with errors <1% of the robot length.

abstract = {Mobile organisms with ability for locomotion and transportation, such as humans and other animals, utilize orchestrated actuation to perform actions. Mimicking these functionalities in synthetic, light-responsive untethered soft-bodied devices remains a challenge. Inspired by multitasking and mobile biological systems, an untethered soft transporter robot with controlled multidirectional locomotion with the ability of picking up, transporting, and delivering cargo driven entirely by blue light is created. The soft robot design is an ensemble of light-responsive liquid crystalline polymers that can harness motion either collectively or individually to obtain a high degree of motion control for the execution of advanced tasks in a dry environment. Through orchestrated motion of the device's “legs”, single displacement strides, which exceed 4 mm and can be taken in any direction, allow for locomotion around objects. Untethered cargo transportation is demonstrated by a pickup and release mechanism using the device's “arms”. This strategy demonstrates the constructive harnessing of orchestrated motion in assemblies of established actuators, performing complex functions, mimicking constructive behavior seen in nature.},

The robotic glove utilizes soft actuators consisting of molded elastomeric chambers with fiber reinforcements that induce specific bending, twisting and extending trajectories under fluid pressurization. These soft actuators were mechanically programmed to match and support the range of motion of individual fingers. They demonstrated the ability to generate significant force when pressurized and exhibited low impedance when un-actuated. To operate the soft robotic glove, a control hardware system was designed and included fluidic pressure sensors in line with the hydraulic actuators and a closed-loop controller to regulate the pressure. Demonstrations with the complete system were performed to evaluate the ability of the soft robotic glove to carry out gross and precise functional grasping. Compared to existing devices, the soft robotic glove has the potential to increase user freedom and independence through its portable waist belt pack and open palm design.},

Real-world, volume-preserving biological tissues have Poisson’s ratios near 1/2, but numerical simulation within this regime is notoriously challenging. In order to robustly capture these visual characteristics, we present a novel version of Neo-Hookean elasticity. Our model maintains the fleshy appearance of the Neo-Hookean model, exhibits superior volume preservation, and is robust to extreme kinematic rotations and inversions. We obtain closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of all of the system’s components, which allows us to directly project the Hessian to semipositive definiteness, and also leads to insights into the numerical behavior of the material. These findings also inform the design of more sophisticated hyperelastic models, which we explore by applying our analysis to Fung and Arruda-Boyce elasticity. We provide extensive comparisons against existing material models.},

After summarizing the basic algorithm, they demonstrate the approach on a high-speed two-degree-of-freedom semi-direct-drive robot. They show that the dynamic parameters of the manipulator, assumed to be initially unknown, can be estimated within the first half second of a typical run, and that accordingly, the manipulator trajectory can be precisely controlled. These experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive controller enjoys essentially the same level of robustness to unmodeled dynamics as a PD (proportional and differential) controller, yet achieves much better tracking accuracy than either PD or computed-torque schemes. Its superior performance for high-speed operations, in the presence of parametric and nonparametric uncertainties, and its relative computational simplicity, make it an attractive option both for addressing complex industrial tasks, and for simplifying high-level programming of more standard operations},

abstract = {Nowadays, the most adopted model for the design and control of soft robots is the piecewise constant curvature model, with its consolidated benefits and drawbacks. In this work, an alternative model for multisection soft manipulator dynamics is presented based on a discrete Cosserat approach, in which the continuous Cosserat model is discretized by assuming a piecewise constant strain along the soft arm. As a consequence, the soft manipulator state is described by a finite set of constant strains. This approach has several advantages with respect to the existing models. First, it takes into account shear and torsional deformations, which are both essential to cope with out-of-plane external loads. Furthermore, it inherits desirable geometrical and mechanical properties of the continuous Cosserat model, such as intrinsic parameterization and greater generality. Finally, this approach allows to extend to soft manipulators, the recursive composite-rigid-body and articulated-body algorithms, whose performances are compared through a cantilever beam simulation. The soundness of the model is demonstrated through extensive simulation and experimental results.},

This is largely due to the intrinsic difficulties in designing controllers for systems with infinite dimensions. This work extends our previously proposed formulation for the dynamics of a soft robot from two to three dimensions. The formulation connects the soft robot's dynamic behavior to a rigid-bodied robot with parallel elastic actuation. The matching between the two systems is exact under the hypothesis of Piecewise Constant Curvature. Based on this connection, we introduce a control architecture with the aim of achieving accurate curvature and bending control. This controller accounts for the natural softness of the system moving in three dimensions, and for the dynamic forces acting on the system. The controller is validated in a realistic simulation, together with a kinematic inversion algorithm. The paper also introduces a soft robot capable of three-dimensional motion, that we use to experimentally validate our control strategy.},

In this paper, we introduce a generic solution that enables a high-rate control and that is compatible with strong real-time constraints. From a Finite Element analysis, computed at low rate, an inverse model of the robot outputs the setpoint values for the actuator in order to obtain a desired trajectory. This inverse problem uses a QP (quadratic-programming) algorithm based on the equations set by the Finite Element Method. To improve the update rate performances, we propose an asynchronous simulation framework that provides a better trade-off between the deformation accuracy and the computational burden. Complex computations such as accurate FEM deformations are done at low frequency while the control is performed at high frequency with strong real-time constraints. The two simulation loops (high frequency and low frequency loops) are mechanically coupled in order to guarantee mechanical accuracy of the system over time. Finally, the validity of the multi-rate simulation is discussed based on measurements of the evolution in the QP matrix and an experimental validation is conducted to validate the correctness of the high-rate inverse model on a real robot.},

@article{Li2017a,
abstract = {Robot manipulators are increasingly used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). They are required to have small size, wide workspace, adequate dexterity and payload ability when operating in confined surgical cavity. Snake-like flexible manipulators are well suited to these applications. However, conventional fully actuated snake-like flexible manipulators are difficult to miniaturize and even after miniaturization the payload is very limited. The alternative is to use underactuated snake-like flexible manipulators. Three prevailing designs are tendon-driven continuum manipulators (TCM), tendon-driven serpentine manipulators (TSM) and concentric tube manipulators (CTM). In this paper, the three designs are compared at the mechanism level from the kinematics point of view. The workspace and distal end dexterity are compared for TCM, TSM and CTM with one, two and three sections, respectively. Other aspects of these designs are also discussed, including sweeping motion, scaling, force sensing, stiffness control, etc. From the results, the tendon-driven designs and concentric tube design complement each other in terms of their workspace, which is influenced by the number of sections as well as the length distribution among sections. The tendon-driven designs entail better distal end dexterity while generate larger sweeping motion in positions close to the shaft.},

abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for controlling a manipulator with hyper degrees of freedom (HDOF). An HDOF manipulator has the capability to achieve various kinds of tasks. To make full use of its capability, shape control is proposed here; that is, not only the tip of a manipulator, but also its whole body is controlled. To formulate control objectives for shape control, we define a shape correspondence between an HDOF manipulator and a spatial curve that prescribes a desired shape. The shape correspondence is defined by using solutions of a nonlinear optimization problem termed the shape-inverse problem. We give theorems on the existence of the solutions, and on an existence region that allows us to convert shape-control problems into more tractable ones. A shape-regulation control problem is considered first to bring an HDOF manipulator onto a given time-invariant curve. The idea of estimating the desired curve parameters is the crucial key to solving the problem by Lyapunov design. The derived shape-regulation law includes the estimator, which infers the desired curve parameters corresponding to the desired joint positions on the curve. The idea of the desired curve-parameter estimation is also effective for shape tracking where a time-varying curve is used for prescribing a moving desired shape. Considering an estimator with second-order dynamics enables us to find two shape-tracking control laws by utilizing conventional tracking methods in manipulator control. We show the simulation results of applying the derived shape-tracking control laws to a 20-DOF manipulator.},

The robot employs a compliant body with embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition, the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing, and control. At the core of the fish's soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained robot. The kinematics and controllability of the robot during simulated escape response maneuvers are analyzed and compared with studies on biological fish. We show that during escape responses, the soft-bodied robot has similar input-output relationships to those observed in biological fish. The major implication of this work is that we show soft robots can be both self-contained and capable of rapid body motion.},

Specifically, we present an extremely soft robotic manipulator morphology that is composed entirely from low durometer elastomer, powered by pressurized air, and designed to be both modular and durable. To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

abstract = {A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation presents a mathematical formulation of the kinematics, dynamics, and control of robot manipulators. It uses an elegant set of mathematical tools that emphasizes the geometry of robot motion and allows a large class of robotic manipulation problems to be analyzed within a unified framework.The foundation of the book is a derivation of robot kinematics using the product of the exponentials formula. The authors explore the kinematics of open-chain manipulators and multifingered robot hands, present an analysis of the dynamics and control of robot systems, discuss the specification and control of internal forces and internal motions, and address the implications of the nonholonomic nature of rolling contact are addressed, as well.The wealth of information, numerous examples, and exercises make A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation valuable as both a reference for robotics researchers and a text for students in advanced robotics courses.},

@article{Till2019,
abstract = {The dynamic equations of many continuum and soft robot designs can be succinctly formulated as a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) based on classical Cosserat rod theory, which includes bending, torsion, shear, and extension. In this work we present a numerical approach for forward dynamics simulation of Cosserat-based robot models in real time. The approach implicitly discretizes the time derivatives in the PDEs and then solves the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) boundary value problem (BVP) in arc length at each timestep. We show that this strategy can encompass a wide variety of robot models and numerical schemes in both time and space, with minimal symbolic manipulation required. Computational efficiency is gained owing to the stability of implicit methods at large timesteps, and implementation is relatively simple, which we demonstrate by providing a short MATLAB-coded example. We investigate and quantify the tradeoffs associated with several numerical subroutines, and we validate accuracy compared with dynamic rod data gathered with a high-speed camera system. To demonstrate the method's application to continuum and soft robots, we derive several Cosserat-based dynamic models for robots using various actuation schemes (extensible rods, tendons, and fluidic chambers) and apply our approach to achieve real-time simulation in each case, with additional experimental validation on a tendon robot. Results show that these models capture several important phenomena, such as stability transitions and the effect of a compressible working fluid.},
