Robotic technology has a rich history in the industrial sector, revolutionizing productivity and precision since the advent of the "Unimate" robot in the 1950s. Today, we are witnessing remarkable advancements in robotic systems that closely resemble biological organisms. However, a significant challenge remains: the safe interaction of robots with their environment. The inherent rigidity and weight of traditional robot materials, such as metals and plastics, make them vulnerable to collisions and impacts, posing risks of potential costly damage. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address this mechanical limitation and enhance the safety and reliability of robotic technology.

In the past two decades, more and more academics and researchers are keen on presenting a possible solution in the form of 'soft robotics'. Inspired by a technology proposed already in early 50's to 90's, e.g the McKibben actuator (1952) or the soft hand by Suzumori et al. (1989), soft robots are constructed using flexible materials like rubber instead of rigid materials and driven by fluidics instead of electricity. Unlike traditional rigid robots, these soft robots have the remarkable capability to imitate the movements and behaviors observed in living organisms. A key advantage of soft robotics lies in their ability to interact safely and delicately with the environment and delicate objects, without relying on advanced stabilizing control techniques. As a result, they possess great potential for a wide array of applications in healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and robotic exploration.Their ability to adapt to their surroundings and change shape makes them versatile and capable of performing a diverse range of tasks. This versatility is frequently derived from the diverse abilities demonstrated by nature. For instance, it draws inspiration from the agile dexterity exhibited by an elephant's trunk and the environmental adaptability displayed by an octopus when navigating narrow spaces. The field is believed to be filling the gaps between robotics and nature.

Despite the early development of soft robotics dating back to the 1950s, its integration within the industrial sector has remained limited. This can be attributed to the numerous open and multidisciplinary challenges that have become apparent, particularly since its recent resurgence in the academic sphere. Firstly, there is a scarcity of approaches that enable the design of robots based on structural deformation for motion. Traditional engineering principles for robotics emphasize the minimization of structural deformation, which contrasts with the unique requirements of soft robotics. Secondly, developing fast and accurate models that facilitate classical controller design, as is commonly done in rigid robotics, proves to be a challenging task. It necessitates a delicate balance between the principles of material science and robotics control theory.

The thesis presents systematic tools to design, model, and control soft robots. First, an optimization framework is introduced for automatically generates soft actuator designs based on user requirements as an faster alternative to ad-hoc design methods. These designs are also produced used 

Second, the thesis develops dynamic models that enable real-time simulation and control of soft robots. Control strategies for soft robots are examined, including energy-shaping controllers that mimic biological movements, highlighting the potential of soft robots in biomimetic applications. 


Lastly, the thesis introduces a MATLAB toolkit named Sorotoki that simplifies the design and control of soft robots, making soft robotics technology more accessible to acadresearchers.
