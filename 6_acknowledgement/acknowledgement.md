When I was young I always wanted to pursue a scientific career. The pursuit of achieving my doctorate's degree has been by far the largest and heaviest stepping stone in that career. I have been extremely fortune not only in the opportunities that (sometimes seemingly) presented themselves in the PhD journey, but also with the people I've met throughout these years.

It is no secret that without these individuals I'd be unable to reach this achievement in life. 

Camiel, for the majority, we undertook the same paths. We did the same Bachelor, Master, and a PhD at the same university. Especially the latter has been a great help to me.
