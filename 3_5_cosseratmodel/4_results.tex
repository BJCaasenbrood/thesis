\section{Simulation studies of bio-inspired soft robots} \label{sec:chap3_result}
In this section, we detail the numerical simulations of the port-Hamiltonian model in \eqref{eq:C3:model_ph} together with the energy-shaping controller in \eqref{eq:C3:control}. 

Due to the partial differential nature, we have to employ a nested ODE routine to recover the trajectories for $\vec{q}$ and $\vec{p}$. First, we employ an implicit trapezoidal solver with a fixed stepsize of $dt = 30 $ ms to solve \eqref{eq:C3:model_ph}. At each time increment, we have to evaluate the dynamic matrices \eqref{eq:C3:lag_M} to \eqref{eq:C3:lag_tau}. To efficiently compute these dynamic entities, we solve the spatial integration problem over the material domain $\Xs$ by using a second-order Runge-Kutta solver.  The stepsize for the spatial solver is chosen sufficiently small $\Delta \sigma = 1$ mm. The spatial stepsize is related to the length of the manipulator $L$, but also the degree of geometric deformations along the backbone. In some cases, high-gain feedback control can excite high-order modes thus requiring a smaller stepsize to capture these phenomena accurately. However, by keeping the control gains small paired with the fact that structural damping is dominant in soft elastomers often lead to slow transients (order of seconds). As such, the spatial discretization has been shown to relatively nonrestrictive. %Generally speaking, choosing $\Delta \sigma = 1\cdot10{-2} L$ is a good rule of thumb. 
All simulation examples and underlying source code are provided publicly on the \texttt{sorotoki} toolkit \cite{Caasenbrood2020}. Here, the numerical integrations of the system matrices \eqref{eq:C3:lag_M}, \eqref{eq:C3:lag_C}, \eqref{eq:C3:lag_G} and \eqref{eq:C3:lag_tau} are performed using a so-called Matrix-Differential solver (see \cite{Caasenbrood2022}). The simulations are performed on a modern machine (Ryzen 7-5800H, 3.2GHz).

For the soft robotic simulations, we have chosen a linear isotropic Hookean material with shear constraints. %Although hyper-elastic material models are possible, e.g, Neo-Hookean or Yeoh, it is considered out of the scope of this work (see \cite{Kim2018,Renaud2011}). 
Given these material properties, the inertia tensor and the stiffness tensor become diagonal matrices:
%
\begin{align*}
\mat{\mathcal{M}} & = \blkdiag{ \rho_0 \mat{\mathcal{J}},\, \rho_0 A \mat{I}_3}, \\[0.25em] 
\mat{\mathcal{K}} & = \blkdiag{\mu_1 \mat{\mathcal{J}},\, E A_0,\, \mu_2  A_0,\,\mu_2  A_0},
\end{align*}
%
 where $A_0$ is the (average) cross-sectional area, and $\mat{\mathcal{J}}$ the second moment of area. Note that $A_0$ and $\mat{\mathcal{J}}$ depend on the cross-sectional geometry of the soft robot and is therefor unique for each system.  The damping tensor chosen as $\mat{\mathcal{D}} = \zeta \mat{\mathcal{K}}$ with damping coefficient $\zeta$. %The visco-elastic matrices are precomputed using \eqref{eq:C3:stiff_mat} and \eqref{eq:C3:damp_mat}.

\subsection{Soft robot manipulator inspired by octopus' tentacle}
In the first study-case, we consider a soft robotic arm that is loosely inspired by the tentacles of an octopus. To introduce the under-actuation typically present in soft robotics, we have chosen an actuation matrix $\mat{G} = \blkdiag{\mat{I}_5, \mat{O}_3}$ such that only the first five modes are actively controllable.  We assume that the soft manipulator has a circular cross-section, thus the cross-sectional area is given by $A_0 = \pi r^2$ with radius $r$. The system properties are shown in Table \ref{tab:C3:parameters1}.

\begin{example}[Solution convergence for increasing modal order]
  \label{ex:C3:convergence}
 Before investigating the performance of the controller, we study the affects of the truncation order $k$. Initially, it can be difficult find the optimal value for $k$ that balances precision and computational speed. Consider the case where we subject the soft robot by a external tip wrench $\tau_\textrm{ext}(t) = [J]_k^\top \left(0,0,\mB(t),0,0,0 \right)^\top$ given by a predefined moment $\mB(t) = 75 \cdot \textrm{erf}(t)$ in \si{\newton \milli \meter}. The applied moment causes a spiraling deformation of the soft arm, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:C3:EX2:mode_convergence_3d}. Observe that the soft arm undergoes a rather complex nonlinear three-dimensional deformation. Now, we incrementally increase the model truncation parameter $k \in \{1,...,10\}$ and investigate the convergence of the solutions $\gammaB_L$ (\ie, the end-effector location). The numerical results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3:EX2:mode_convergence}.

 Furthermore, we compare these simulation runs with a high-order mode of $k = 25$, where investigate the root mean square error, absolute error, and the ratio between actual CPU simulation time $T_{\textrm{sim}}$ and finite horizon $T$. The benchmark is shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3:EX2:mode_convergence_bench}. From these results, we observe that the solutions quickly converge to a narrow error band, namely for $k>3$ the difference in trajectories is near negligible. The RMS error is about $3.25$ \si{\milli \meter} or $2.7\%$ normalized by $L$.  Regarding computation time, we observe a linear decrease for a linear increase in modal order $k$. Note that for $k > 8$, the simulations are close to losing real-time performance. We therefore choose a modal basis of order $k = 8$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Energy-based controller]
Following, we now subjected the soft robot to the proposed energy-based controller in \eqref{eq:C3:control}, where the control gains are tuned to produce a smooth transient: $\lambda_1 = 0.01$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.001$. The artificial spring stiffness is chosen as $\mat{k}_p = \blkdiag{0.01\cdot \mat{I}_3, \mat{I}_3}$. Lastly, the desired configuration of the end-effector is chosen as follows:
%
\begin{equation*}
\mat{g}_d = \begin{pmatrix} \mat{I}_3 & \mat{\gamma}_d \\ \vec{0}_3^\top & 1 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{with} \quad \mat{\gamma}_d = \begin{pmatrix}  0.04 \\ 0.00 \\ -0.01  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
%
The numerical results of the closed-loop system are shown in Figure \ref{fig:octarm1} and \ref{fig:octarm1_states}. It is worth mentioning that these simulation run at $\pm120$ \si{\hertz} real-time.$^{1}$ \blankfootnote{$^{1}$Real-time bandwidth is determined by the ratio between finite horizon and CPU's computation time, \ie, $f \approx T/T_{\textrm{sim}}$,which is affected most by spatial stepsize due to explicit integration.} 

Figure \ref{fig:octarm1} shows the evolution of the continuous deformation along the soft robotic body, whereas Figure \ref{fig:octarm1_states} shows the modal coefficients $\vec{q}(t)$ and generalized momenta $\vec{p}(t)$. As can be seen, the end-effector of the soft robot manipulator converges to the desired set-point $\mat{g}_d \in \SE{3}$. Although the control gains could be increased to promote a faster transient, it was observed that high gains lead to undesired (propagating) oscillations of the flexible structure. A possible solution might be to introduce negative damping to the controller Hamiltonian $\Hm_d$, to overcome the soft robot's structural damping.

For the second simulation run, we modified the control gains to highlight an interesting property of the proposed controller. To be more specific, we increase the controller gains to $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0.1$. The numerical results for the increased controller gains are shown in Figure \ref{fig:octarm2} and Figure \ref{fig:octarm2_states}. Although the control goal and the initial conditions are chosen identical, the soft robot converges to a different configuration -- albeit, a shape with less '\textit{complexity}'. The cause of less complicated bending patterns has two origins. First, increasing the control gains also artificially impacts the structural stiffness of the soft robot, resulting in soft robot with a higher perceived stiffness. Second, by increasing the stabilizing term $\lambda_2$ in the damped Jacobian inverse \eqref{eq:C3:jacob_damped}, more weight is given towards finding a solution that also minimizes the joint angles $\lVert \vec{q} \rVert_2 $.  This is to be expected, as intrinsically, it requires more energy to achieve higher-order modes deformations $\{\theta_n\}_{n=1}^k$ of the Legendre basis. Hence, the energy-based controller will thus find a minimizer that accounts for the ordering of the shape basis, penalizing higher-order modes. To some extent, the high intrinsic damping in soft robots acts as a spatial low filter which is beneficial for both modeling as control. This effect is not observed in classical semi-rigid robots.  This result indicates that the proposed controller can be effectively tuned alter the structural compliance of the soft robot; and thus could be implemented carefully to preserve '\textit{softness}'.

\subsection{Multi-link soft robot inspired by the elephant's trunk}
In the second study-case, we consider a two-link soft robot that is inspired by the trunk of an elephant. A similar soft robotic system is considered in \cite{Falkenhahn2015} (\ie, the elephant-inspired bionic arm by \texttt{Festo}), where mobility of the bio-inspired robotic system is achieved through a pneumatic-network distributed along the continuous body of the robot. Therefore, considering a six-bellow network, the fluidic actuation matrix takes the form:
%
\begin{equation*}
\mat{G}(\vec{q})\vec{u} = \sum_{n=1}^6 \left[ \int_\Xs [\mat{J}]_k^\top(\sigma,\vec{q}) \thetaB_{\textrm{u},i}(\sigma)\; d\sigma\right] u_i,
\end{equation*}
%
where $\{\thetaB_{\textrm{u},i}\}_{n=1}^6$ is a set of piecewise constant wrench functions related to the pneumatic actuation bellows distributed along the soft robotic body, and $\vec{u} = (u_1,\,u_2,\,u_3,\,u_4,\,u_5,\,u_6)^\top$ a vector of wrench amplitudes. The control input sets $\{u_1,..,u_3\}$ relate to the first link and $\{u_4,..,u_6\}$ to the second link of the robot. Given this input configuration, it also follows that $\rank(\mat{G}(\vec{q})) < \dim(\vec{q})$ for all $\vec{q} \in \R^{6k}$, \ie, underactuated. The system and solver properties are given in Table \ref{tab:C3:parameters2}. We again consider $k=8$ spatial modes. To simulate the effect of the gripper, we added an inertial mass at the end-effector modeled by:
%
$$\tauB_{\textrm{ext}} =  \ten{M}_{\textrm{grip}}\,\JB(L,\q)^\top \left[ \left(\vec{0}_3^\top,\, \aB_g ^\top \Ad^\top_{[\gB]_k(L,\cdot)} \right)^\top + [\dot{\etaB}]_k(L,\q,\dq,\ddq) \right],$$
%
where $\ten{M}_{\textrm{grip}}$ inertia tensor related to the gripper placed at the end-effector of the robot located at $\sigma = L$. Again we apply the energy-based controller in \eqref{eq:C3:control} to the system, where the control gains are $\lambda_1 = 5$ and $\lambda_2 = 1$, while the artificial stiffness matrix $\mat{k}_p$ is kept identical to previous simulations. Lastly, the desired configuration of the end-effector is chosen as follows:
%
\begin{equation*}
\mat{g}_d = \begin{pmatrix} \mat{\Phi}_d & \mat{\gamma}_d \\ \vec{0}_3^\top & 1 \end{pmatrix} \; \text{with} \; \mat{\gamma}_d = \begin{pmatrix} 0.125 & \!0.100\! & 0.175 \end{pmatrix}^\top \;\text{and} \; \PhiB_d = \textrm{Rot}_y\left(\tfrac{1}{4}\pi \right).
\end{equation*}

\vspace{-2mm}
The numerical results of the closed-loop system are shown in Figure \ref{fig:C3:multilink_3D} and Figure \ref{fig:C3:multilink_states} which could reach a real-time simulation bandwidth of $<65$ Hz. Figure \ref{fig:C3:multilink_3D} shows the continuous deformation along the soft robotic body, while Figure \ref{fig:C3:multilink_states} shows the trajectories of the modal coefficients $\vec{q}(t)$ and the generalized momenta $\vec{p}(t)$. As can be seen, the end-effector of the soft robot manipulator slowly converges to the desired set-point $\mat{g}_d \in \SE{3}$, even when dealing with piece-wise distributed actuation loads applied to the continuous backbone. To describe the discontinuous actuation profiles, however, higher order modes are required as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:C3:multilink_states}. This might indicate there exist better tailored compact shape bases for this soft robotic system.

\section[Achieving bio-inspired motion through energy-based control]{Achieving bio-inspired motion through energy-based control using relaxed set-points}
For in our third study case, we wish to pursue the typical biological motions found in nature via means of model-based control. In particular, we are interested in the experimental recording made by Sumbre et al. \cite{Sumbre2001Sep} of an octopus. Their worked studied the goal-directed arm movements of the octopus, produced by the nervous system to generate a sequence of motor commands that bring the arm closer towards the target. Note that the control of the octopus arm is highly complex, as the arm can be moved in any direction with a virtually infinite DoFs. According to \cite{Sumbre2001Sep}, the octopus reduces control complexity of this soft arms using highly stereotypical movements that arise from localized motor control embedded in the arm rather than a centralized controller. %$^1$\blankfootnote{The main contribution of \cite{Sumbre2001Sep} highlighted that \textit{"basic motor program"} for voluntary movement (\ie, low-level motion controller) is embedded within the neural circuitry of the arm rather than a centralized brain. This was shown by "decerebrating" the arm, \ie, decoupling of the brain, and carefully placed electrodes, it was possible electrically evoke stereotypical bend propagation.}
Figure \ref{fig:C3:octopus_simu_real} shows such well-known stereotypical motion primitives, namely a bending propagating wave.

Notice it produces a motion highly reminiscent of the true biological counterpart.}  \label{fig:C3:octopus_simu_real}
  \vspace{-5mm}
\end{figure*}

Our objective is to qualitatively reproduce these experimental findings, where we aim to seek a model-based control law that, like the octopus \cite{Sumbre2001Sep}, explores such stereotypical motion like bending wave propagation likely to preserve energy expensive. While the Cosserat can describe strain propagation, looking at our previous simulations, we do not observe them. Thus indicative of a mismatch in motion control, we make an ansatz that there are minor ingredients missing in the energy-shaping controller \eqref{eq:C3:control}, but more importantly, the way we define the control task. We inspire our modifications on the sensorimotor feedback control proposed by Wang et al. \cite{Wang2022Dec} (inspired by \cite{Justh2006Jun}). Rather than end-effector setpoint stabilization as in prior examples, they instead minimize the Euclidean distance between the target and anywhere on the backbone curve. Here, we propose several modifications: ($i$) we explore a energy-shaping technique \eqref{eq:C3:control} with full system information, $(ii)$ we introduce terms that also minimize the energy spent on elastic structural deformation using null-space projections \cite{Murray1994,Spong2006}, and $(iii)$ we use geodesics in $\SE{3}$ for the task rather than $\R^3$. The latter implies we look at position as orientation information. The controller in \eqref{eq:C3:control} is modified by choosing a different desired energy gradient $\nabla_\q \,\mathcal{U}_d$:
%
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\q\, \mathcal{U}_d = \lambda_1 {\JB_d}^\dag\ten{F}_\textrm{u}(\ten{E}_{\textrm{d}}) - \lambda_3 \left(\IB - \JB_{d} {\JB_{d}}^\dag\right) \nabla_\q\,\mathcal{U}\elastic,
\label{eq:C3:control_relaxed}
\end{equation}
%
where $\JB_d := \JB(\sigma_d,\q)$, its pseudo inverse as $\JB_d^\dag = \mat{J}_d^\top\bigl(\JB_d {\JB_d}^\top + \lambda_2 \mat{I} \bigr)\inv$, $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ the control gains, and ${\ten{E}}_d = \widehat{\log}_{\textrm{SE}(3)}([\gB]_k\inv(\sigma_d,\q),\gB_d)$ the optimal geodesic error with $\sigma_d$ an adaptive spatial coordinate that minimizes the geodesic distance between the backbone curve and the desired target setpoint $\gB_d$. To be specific, this adaptive geodesic minimizer is found using
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_d = \underset{\sigma \in (0,L]}{\textrm{argmin}} \;  \left\lVert \widehat{\log}_{\textrm{SE}(3)}\big([\gB]_k\inv(\sigma_d),\gB_d \big) \right\rVert_2,
\end{equation}
%
which is found using a line search algorithm. Note that the latter RHS term of \eqref{eq:C3:control_relaxed} controls the degree of residual elastic flexibility of the system that, by exploring null-space projections, does not obstruct the primary control objective. Therefore, unlike \cite{Wang2022Dec}, we do not require gain activation functions parameterized by $\sigma$ as we are exploring intrinsic structural redundancies.

Inline with the recording from \cite{Sumbre2001Sep} (Figure \ref{fig:C3:octopus_simu_real}), we consider a soft robot model with parameters similar to Table \ref{tab:C3:parameters1} albeit with $L = 135$ \si{\milli \meter}. The control gains are tuned to $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0.1$ and $\lambda_3 = 0.01$, whereas the desired target is $\PhiB_d = \IB_3$ and $\gammaB_d = (70, 0, 40)^\top$. To simulate the viscous drag caused by the moving fluid, we model an external distributed wrench $\ten{F}_{\textrm{drag}} = -\frac{1}{2}\rho_{\textrm{w}} \lVert\JB \dq\rVert \ten{A}_{\textrm{drag}} \JB \dq $ where $\rho_{\textrm{w}} = 1000$ $\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$ is the water density, and $\ten{A}_{\textrm{drag}}$ a drag coefficient tensor. %The generalized drag force is then $\tauB_{\textrm{drag}}= \int_\Xs [\JB]_k^\top\ten{F}_{\textrm{drag}} \; d\sigma$ similar to the computation of \eqref{eq:C3:lag_tau} and \eqref{eq:C3:lag_G}.

The results of the numerical simulation are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:C3:octopus_simu_real} and Figure \ref{fig:C3:bend_propogate}, illustrating sequential snapshots of the continuous deformations exhibited by the flexible appendage. The location of $\sigma_d$ shown as ($\textcolor{blue}{\bullet}$), while the temporal and spatial evolution of the curvature strain field $\kappa:=[\xi_2]_k$ is represented. Notably, we observe that the trajectories of the closed-loop system bear a striking resemblance to those observed in the authentic biological counterpart. Particularly noteworthy is the immediate akinship of the wave-like propagation characteristic of the bending motion commonly associated with octopus' arms. This bending wave starts from $\sigma_d = 41.5$ mm ($t=0$ s) and at near the end of the wave $\sigma_d = 126.3$ mm ($t=1.3$ s), the wave-speed along the arm is $\dot{\sigma}_d = 65.07$ mm s$\inv$. Although these are naturally related to chosen control gains, these velocity measures are inline with literature. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate life-like movements of the soft arm, which emphasizes the importance of model-based control in the field of soft robotics on the premise that these systems should ultimately mimic nature.

The highly flexible appendage allows for traveling bending wave propagation, while the octopus orients its suckers towards the object to ensure a secure grip \cite{Sumbre2001Sep}.
