\chapterabstract{
In this chapter, we address some of the limitation of the previous \textit{Piecewise-Constant-Curvature} (PCC) model presented in Chapter \ref{chap:PCC}, in particular the infinite-dimensionality of the soft robot's deformable body.  The continuous dynamics of the soft robot are modeled through the differential geometry of Cosserat beams. Contrary to the PCC model, a wide variety of spatial discretization can be used that better respect the spatial continuity and continuum mechanics of the system. Using a finite-dimensional truncation, the infinite-dimensional system can be written as a reduced-order port-Hamiltonian (pH) model that preserves desirable passivity conditions. Then,a model-based controller is introduced that produces a local minimizer of closed-looppotential energy for the desired end-effector configuration. The stabilizing control utilizes an energy-based approach and exploits the passivity of soft robotic system. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated through extensive simulations of various soft manipulators that share a resemblance with biology

% The infinite-dimensional nature of soft robots has emphasized the difficulty in modeling and control, leading to the classic trade-off between precision and speed. In the last decade, two modeling strategies have dominated the field: \textit{(i)} Finite-Element-Method (FEM) models and \textit{(ii)} soft beam models (\eg, Cosserat models). While FEM enables highly accurate deformations, Lagrangian-based beam models allow for faster computation and ease of controllers design akin to rigid robotics. In this chapter, we propose a mixture between the two modeling approaches by extracting geometric modal information of FEM simulation data. Our approach leads to fast, accurate, and generic low-dimensional models that encode the geometric features and the elasticity of the original soft body into a new strain functional basis -- we call a Geometry-Informed Variable Strain (GIVS) basis. Robustness of the technique is investigated for several systems. Also the nonlinearities with increasing actuation frequency, under environmental contact modeled by signed distance functions, and multi-input pneumatic actuation. Furthermore, we also provide a qualitative comparison between existing strategies, demonstrating that our approach can improve accuracy and speed compared traditional techniques. Also, experiments are performed to highlight the model's transferability to reality.}
